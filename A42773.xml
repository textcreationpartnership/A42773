            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE two only things that ſhould induce any one to give his Teſtimony and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation unto Diſcourſes that are publiſhed for publick uſe, are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Argument treated on, and the uſeful judicious handling of it, in thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. Whatever elſe may be, or uſually is ſpoken unto, on ſuch occaſions, is a diverſion from what ought to be intended, and what is expected by all them who give ſuch Prefaces the peruſal. But both theſe in the enſuing Diſcourſes ſeem to be ſuch, and ſo ſtated, as to render any Recommendation of mine in this way needleſs and ſuperfluous. For the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument treated of, being the Covenants of God with Chriſt the Mediator, and with the Church in him, there are none who have any acquaintance with Chriſtian Religion, or care of their own Souls, but muſt, and will acknowledg it to be of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt weight in it ſelf, and higheſt concernment unto
<pb facs="tcp:58137:3"/>them. For the Doctrine hereof, or the truth herein, is the very Center wherein all the lines concerning the Grace of God and our own duty, do meet; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the whole of Religion doth conſiſt. Hence unto the underſtanding, Notions, and Conceptions, that men have of theſe Covenants of God, and according as the Doctrine of them is ſtated in their minds, their Conceptions of all other ſacred Truths, or Doctrines, are conformed. And therefore as they who have right apprehenſions, and a true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe things, cannot in the uſe of diligence, and the means appointed thereunto, lightly mistake the Truth in any other point of weight in the whole compaſs of Religion; ſo thoſe who unhappily fall under miſapprehenſion about them, do generally either fluctuate in their own minds about all other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Truths, or do corrupt and pervert the whole Doctrine concerning them. And hereon alſo depends the regulation of all our intire Chriſtian practiſe or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as all will acknowledg who have any knowledg of theſe things. It ſeems therefore altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that there ſhould be any new Recommendation of the ſubject-matter of the enſuing Diſcourſes, unto thoſe who ſeriouſly mind their own Spiritual and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concerns; and as unto others, it is to no purpoſe to declare the worth and nature of ſuch Pearls unto them. As for the manner of the Declaration or handling of theſe ſacred Truths in the enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, the known Abilities, Piety, Learning, and Judgment of this Author, with that leaſure he had to add his laſt thoughts and conſiderations unto them, are ſufficient to give the Sober Reader an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of as much ſatisfaction as he is like to meet withal
<pb facs="tcp:58137:3"/>in endeavours of this nature. I cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but judg that there is little need of this Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I am deſired to give unto this excellent and uſeful Treatiſe. Howbeit, that I may not ſeem wholly to condemn my ſelf in what I do, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that there were ſome reaſons which induced me to comply with the deſire of the worthy Publiſher of it. My long Chriſtian acquaintance, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Author, made me not unwilling to teſtifie my Reſpects unto him and his Labours in the Church of God, now he is at Reſt, for whom I had ſo great an eſteem whilſt he was alive. And whereas the whole Deſign and end of my ſelf, as unto others, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the knowledg of the truths of the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the practiſe of them; I knew not but that with ſome at leaſt, this occaſional word might one way or other conduce unto that end. I ſhall therefore briefly and plainly give an account of my thoughts concerning this Diſcourſe, which I have with ſome diligence and great ſatisfaction peruſed. Very many learned and godly perſons have laboured in the ſame ſubject unto the edification of the Church: I intend them only who agreeing in the truth as to the ſubstance of it, may yet differ in ſome conceptions about it, or the way of Explanation of it. For it is not unuſeful that the ſame truth, eſpecially that which is of ſo great importance as is what concerneth the Covenant, be variouſly handled by many, according unto the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt which they have received; ſo whereas we know all but in part, if we have, as we ought to have, a continual ſenſe of the imperfection of our knowledg, none ought to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended if they meet with ſome difference in Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:58137:4"/>and Expoſitions about things of leſſer moment, among thoſe who agree in the ſubſtance of what they do propoſe: Perfect Harmony, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all things, is the priviledg only of the ſacred Writers who were Divinely inſpired. But from the firſt day that the management of Religion was in the Providence of God entruſted with them who had not an infallible Guidance, there is an apparent evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſuch differences as thoſe we ſpeak of, amongſt them all; even the beſt and wiſeſt of them. We may therefore allow them all their juſt Commendation who have laboured diligently in the inveſtigation of the Truth, although ſome of them have not eſcaped various miſtakes about it. Nor is it ſpoken with any reflection on the endeavours of others who have written on this ſubject, when I do freely declare my judgment, That for Order, Method, Perſpicuity in treating, and ſolidity of Argument, the enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe exceedeth whatſoever ſingle Treatiſe I have ſeen written with the ſame deſign; as it alſo is entirely compliant with the Doctrine of the Goſpel, in what is aſſented in it. Three things may be expected in diſcourſes of this nature, or however the ſubject requires that they may be attended unto.</p>

            <p>Each of theſe the Reverend and Learned Author of the enſuing Diſcourſe had an eſpecial regard unto; and how he hath diſcharged himſelf in them all, will quickly appear unto every judicious and attentive Reader. I am ſure I ſhall not offend in wiſhing that others may find the ſame ſatisfaction in their peruſal, as I have done. Wiſh, I heartily do alſo, that as many of thoſe as can with convenience, who deſire a good and ſafe Guide in theſe important truths, in the declaration whereof ſo many have run into extreams, even unto the hazard of the Souls of Men, and would have their hearts excited unto their practiſe, would furniſh themſelves with what is here tendered unto them. For I find that in what is Doctrinal in the whole Diſcourſe, wherein a great and excellent part of the Myſtery of the Goſpel is unfolded, the Reverend Author hath fully weighed, not only what can be ſaid in the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of what he aſſerts, but alſo what can be ſaid againſt it, or be ſet up in competition with it, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Truth with ſucceſsful Evidence, and clear Demonſtration. And as unto what is Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as he had the experience of it in his own Soul, ſo there is nothing wanting that might give the ſeverals inſiſted on, a due impreſſion on the Minds and Affections of others. Soundneſs in Doctrine, Gravity in Speech, Conviction in Argument, Power in Exhortation, Clearneſs and Perſpicuity in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with a nervous intertexture of Scripture-Testimonies and Reaſon, throughout the whole, all evidencing their ſpring in this work to have been, Zeal for the Glory of God, Love of the Truth, and Compaſſion towards the Souls of Men, do in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Foundation of the Covenant of Grace, or of the Covenant of Redemption. Where, <hi>1.</hi> 'Tis proved that there is ſuch a Covenant with Chriſt. <hi>2.</hi> That this is the foundation of the Covenant made with us.</head>
               <p>AS the Covenant of Grace hath its riſe from God only, and from Grace; ſo 'tis founded and bottomed upon nothing in us, but upon God's Covenant with Chriſt, whom he gave <hi>for a Covenant of the people,</hi> Iſa. 49.8; whom he <hi>layed in Zion for a foundation, a ſure foundation,</hi> Iſa. 28.16. The Covenant made with us, did ſpring out of the Covenant made with Chriſt; and as 'tis commonly diſtinguiſhed, the <hi>Covenant of reconciliation,</hi> whereby we are actually reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and reconciled unto God, is bottomed upon the <hi>Covenant of Redemption;</hi> or as others ſpeak, the <hi>Covenant of ſuretiſhip,</hi> whereby the recovery, redemption and reſtitution of fallen man, was tranſacted betwixt God and Chriſt. I ſhall therefore ſpeak a little of the Covenant of Redemption, to make way for the better underſtanding of the whole Treatiſe of the Covenant of Grace; and particularly what relates to Chriſt the Mediator.</p>
               <p>And, 1. That there is a Covenant betwixt God and Chriſt; though the name of this myſterious tranſaction, which we call the Covenant of Redemption and Suretiſhip, be not found in the Scripture, in ſo many words (which may be among the reaſons why moſt Writers have been ſilent about the thing); yet the thing it ſelf being ſo evidently held forth in the Scripture,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. c. 6.</note> The Scriptures (I ſay) being ſo very pregnant in this proof, I ſhall the more brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpatch it,<note place="margin">E. <hi>Bulk</hi> Goſp. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>p.</hi> 29.</note> and refer the Reader to what is written of it by others, every way more fit to open this myſterie, than I am.</p>
               <p>The firſt proof I take from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20, 21, <hi>And the Redeemer ſhall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from tranſgreſſion in Jacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jo. Cocc. <hi>Summa doctrinae de ſoedere.</hi> c. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaith the Lord: As for me, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Where we read of a Covenant betwixt the Lord and the Redeemer, that was to come unto <hi>Zion,</hi> which can be no other but the Covenant of Redemption. For clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, Conſider 1. That he to whom the Lord ſpeaks there, moſt be Chriſt and no other; For 1. 'Tis he only, whoſe ſeed have the Spirit and Word enſured unto them; for the ſeed of no Church-Society upon earth hath the Spirit and the Ordinances appropriated and enſured unto them, only Chriſt's ſeed have the promiſe of the Spirit and the Word appropriated and enſured unto them for ever, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29, <hi>And if ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams Jeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</hi> And the Churches ſeed have this Promiſe and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant only in ſo far as they are Chriſt's ſeed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3, <hi>I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thy off-ſpring.</hi> 2. Becauſe 'tis Chriſt only, who hath in ſtore the Spirit which is given to all his ſeed; though all Chriſt's ſeed receive of the fame Spirit of the Lord, yet it cannot be ſaid of any of them, nor of the Church in general, that their ſeed receive the Spirit that is upon them, or in them; to wit, by communication of any part of the meaſure and proportion given to them; but of Chriſt's only, who received <hi>not the ſpirit by meaſure,</hi> Joh. 3.34. Nor can it be ſaid, <hi>My ſpirit that is upon thee—ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thy ſeed,</hi> Gal. 4.6. <hi>And becauſe ye are Sons, God bath
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58137:14"/>ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba, father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it be conſidered, that this is not only a Covenant made with Chriſt; but it muſt needs be the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: For although, 1. There be mention here made of his ſeed, which are not Parties in the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet nothing is ſpoken to them, but only to Chriſt, and of them, as a party not treated with, but about whom there was treaty and Covenant 'twixt God and Chriſt; for ſtill the ſpeech is to Chriſt in the ſecond perſon, <hi>upon thee, thy ſeed,</hi> and <hi>thy mouth,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Although there be here mention of a Covenant <hi>with them</hi> that turn from ungodlineſs in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and of Promiſes concerning the ſeed of Chriſt; yet that amounts to no more, than that they are the ſubject matter of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant tranſacted betwixt God and Chriſt; and that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them ſprings out of the Covenant with him, and is the reſult and execution thereof. So that I take the meaning of the words, <hi>This is my Covenant with them, my ſpirit that is upon thee,</hi> &amp;c. to be, This is my Covenant that I have made with thee upon their account, and for their behoof; or the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that I have made with them, to wit, <hi>virtually,</hi> when I covenanted with thee, and made promiſes to thee for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof; the reſult whereof, ſhould amount unto a Covenant with them <hi>actually.</hi> And I ſay, it can be no other upon the matter but the Covenant of Redemption: 1. Becauſe 'tis made with the <hi>Redeemer</hi> that ſhould come out of <hi>Zion,</hi> or with Chriſt as deſigned Mediator and Redeemer in the counſel of God, long before he came in the Fleſh. 2. Becauſe 'tis a Covenant about the Redemption and recovery of the Elect people of God, who are the only ſubject matter treated about in this Covenant; as appears from the Text, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Proof, I take from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89, where the Covenant made with Chriſt is held forth as the Original, Foundation and Eſtabliſhment of the Covenant made with his ſeed; and Chriſt is ſpoke of under the name of <hi>David,</hi> with whom he changes Names in the Scripture, and who was a type of Chriſt in many things, but eminently in the Covenant that God made with him, and that he was a publick perſon, and a King by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>v.</hi> 3, <hi>I have made a Covenant with my choſen.</hi> God having choſe Chriſt, for performing the work of Redemption,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58137:15"/>did make a Covenant with him. Two things being cleared in that Pſalm, it will amount to a full proof of the point in hand: 1. That the Covenant ſpoken of there, is made with Chriſt. 2. That it is the Covenant of Redemption that is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For the firſt, that the perſon ſpoken of under the name of <hi>David,</hi> and with whom the Covenant was made, is Chriſt and no other, is evident from feveral expreſſions which are peculiar to Chriſt's Perſon and Kingdom, and cannot be applyed to <hi>David,</hi> further than he was a type of Chriſt: This <hi>David</hi> is the <hi>mighty one</hi> upon whom God <hi>laid the help</hi> of his people, <hi>v.</hi> 19. 'Tis he upon whom <hi>the enemy ſhall not exact,</hi> v. 22. 'Tis he who is <hi>higher then the Kings of the earth,</hi> v. 27. whoſe <hi>ſeed endures for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven,</hi> and <hi>to all generations,</hi> v. 4, 29, 36, 37. 'Tis he who is diſtinguiſhed from his ſeed by this difference, that they may <hi>ſin</hi> and be <hi>chaſtiſed,</hi> v. 30; which caſe is not put of himſelf, but only of his ſeed; 'tis he, by the force and vertue of whoſe Covenant, his ſinful ſeed are not caſt out from Covenant-kindneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 33, 34, 35. and this could be no other but Chriſt: And to put the matter out of queſtion, the Covenant and Promiſes made here, <hi>v.</hi> 27, and in the parallel-Scripture, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14, are applyed unto Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this was the Covenant of Redemption, which God ſaith he made with his <hi>choſen David,</hi> i. e. Chriſt, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered alſo from the Text. 1. It is the Covenant by which Chriſ is conſtituted a Servant, and engaged in the Service of the Lord about our Redemption, <hi>v.</hi> 4, <hi>I have made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with my choſen,—David my ſervant.</hi> 2. 'Tis the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by which the help of the People of God is laid on Chriſt, as a mighty, potent, reſponſal perſon, able for the work, <hi>v.</hi> 19, <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty.</hi> 3. 'Tis the Covenant by which Chriſt is a King and a Prieſt, and is deſigned and deſtinated, called and ſeparated unto Offices for the work of Redemption, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20, 26, 27, <hi>I have exalted one choſen out of the people, with my oyl have I annointed him,</hi> &amp;c. 4. 'Tis the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by which Chriſt received commands to fulfil his offices, and to depend upon God in the doing of the work, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, my Father, and my God, thou art the rock of my Salvation.</hi> 5. 'Tis the Covenant by which Chriſt had peculiar promiſes made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58137:15"/>unto him, of aſſiſtance for the work of Redemption, and help to the people of God, <hi>v.</hi> 21, <hi>Mine arm alſo ſhall ſtrengthen him,</hi> &amp;c. of glorious victory, <hi>v.</hi> 23, <hi>I will beat down his foes,</hi> &amp;c. and exaltation, <hi>v.</hi> 27, <hi>I will make him my firſt born, higher than the Kings of the earth.</hi> Of a ſeed and off-ſpring to endure for ever, <hi>v.</hi> 29, <hi>His ſeed alſo will I make to endure,</hi> &amp;c. Now this could be no other but the Covenant of Redemption; for by no Covenant is Chriſt engaged in this Service, called unto theſe Offices, undertaker of the Peoples help, receiver of ſuch commands and promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by this Covenant of Suretiſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If it be ſaid, That here are many things ſpoken which relate to Chriſt's ſeed, and which do belong to the Covenant of reconciliation; ſuch as the keeping Covenant-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy with Chriſt's ſeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We are not to conceive of the Covenant of Redemption in ſuch an abſtracted conſideration and notion, as if the things tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacted in that Covenant made with Chriſt, had no relation to, nor connexion with the Covenant made with us; but upon the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we are ſtill to keep in mind the great affinity and connexion that is between theſe two Covenants, and as the Apoſtle reaſons from the one to the other, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2, <hi>For he ſaith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccoured thee.</hi> Where he looks upon what God ſaid to Chriſt concerning us, and the hearing of him for us, as ſpoken for our encouragement, to apply to him in the improvement of the day of Grace. Yet I ſay of this Scripture; 1. Here is nothing ſpoken of Chriſt's ſeed and people, as parties with whom God deals in this Covenant, and upon whom he layeth any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, nor to whom directly he maketh any promiſes, (except what may be gathered <hi>conſequenter &amp; in obliquo</hi>) which things muſt needs be in the Covenant of reconciliation. 2. Whatſoever is ſpoken here concerning Chriſt's ſeed and people, 'tis only of the force of the Covenant made and ſworn with Chriſt; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence towards the eſtabliſhment of friendſhip with them, and toward their perſeverance in a Covenant-ſtate; becauſe of God's tranſactions with Chriſt; wherein they were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and by which they and their intereſts were diſpoſed of.</p>
               <p>The third Proof, I take from theſe Scriptures which hold forth all the eſſentials and requiſites for making up a formal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58137:16"/>Covenant, to be betwixt God and Chriſt; which Texts though they ſpeak not explicitely of the name of a Covenant; yet they do explicitely hold forth the thing.</p>
               <p>The Argument in form is this: Where all things neceſſarily required unto the eſſence and being of a Covenant for matter and form, are to be found; there muſt needs be a Covenant. But betwixt God and Chriſt in the matter of our Redemption, all things neceſſary unto the eſſence of a Covenant are to be found: Therefore there muſt needs be a Covenant betwixt God and Chriſt about the work of Redemption, which we call the <hi>Covenant of Suretiſhip or Redemption.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is manifeſt and undeniable: I come therefore to confirm the <hi>minor.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, I ſhall firſt tell you what are the neceſſary requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites unto the eſſence of a Covenant, and then give plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-proof that theſe were betwixt God and Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is generally acknowledged by the Doctors of the Law, that the agreement or conſent of two or more Parties upon the ſame thing, maketh a Paction; and that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals upon the one part,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ulpian</hi> de Pollicit. L. Pactum &amp; L. <hi>1.</hi> F. de Pact.</note> and a conſent upon the other, makes a formal Covenant, though there were no condition or reſtipulation.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But more particularly and above all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, where there are Propoſals, Commands, or Promiſes upon the one part, with condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions required upon the other, and a conſent unto,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Panormit ubi ſupra Azor. inſtit. Moral.</hi> p. 3. l. 11. de Pollicit. c. 1. &amp; l. 6. c. 3.</note> or acceptation of theſe Propoſals, with the conditions required upon the other part, or where there is a reſtipulation of conditions upon the other part, there muſt needs be a Contract or Covenant, not only <hi>materially</hi> and <hi>virtually,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is all the eſſentials of a Covenant; but <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>explicitly,</hi> becauſe there are all the formalities of explicite Covenanting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is manifeſt, that all theſe things are to be found betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, concerning the work of Redemption. 1. There is a conſent and agreement betwixt God and Chriſt about this very thing, which amounteth to a Paction, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13, The Lord ſpeaking of that ineffable myſterious Oeconomy and diſpenſation of the buſineſs of man's Redemption and Salvation,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58137:16"/>as the ſame is tranſacted in the counſel of God's Will; biddeth him tell us, that <hi>the counſel of peace ſhall be between them both;</hi> to wit,<note place="margin">See <hi>Pemble</hi> on <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13. &amp; Jo. Cocc <hi>de foedere,</hi> c 5. Sect. 88.</note> between <hi>the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and <hi>the man whoſe name is the Branch,</hi> v. 12; betwixt them was the buſineſs plotted, conſulted and concluded; to the ſame purpoſe are theſe Scriptures that tell us of the agreement of the Lord's Will, and Chriſt's Will in this affair; it was his Father's Will to ſend him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40, <hi>And this is the will of him that ſent me.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 3.26, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him,</hi> &amp;c. and it was Chriſt's Will to be ſent, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9, <hi>Then ſaid he, Lo, I come to do thy will,</hi> Joh. 6.38, <hi>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me;</hi> it was his Father's will that he ſhould lay down his life, and it was his will alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.</hi> Joh. 10.18, <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This Commandment have I received of my father; it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him,</hi> Iſai. 53.10. and it pleaſed him to be bruiſed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.6, <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> Still there was an agreement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We find clear veſtiges in the Scripture of Propoſals made by <hi>Jehovah</hi> unto Chriſt, concerning his Will about the work of our Redemption; and of a conſent and agreement upon Chriſt's part unto theſe Propoſals; whereby he declares his will to be conſenting to his Father's Will. The firſt, to wit, Propoſals made by God to Chriſt, we read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footſtool;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7, 8, <hi>I will declare the decree, the Lord hath ſaid unto me, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me and I will give thee, the heathen for: thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> That theſe Scriptures contain Propoſals, is manifeſt; and that they are Propoſals made by <hi>Jehovah</hi> to Chriſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Holy Ghoſts aſſerting it, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33, <hi>God hath confirmed the ſame unto us their children, in that he hath raiſed up Jeſus again; as it is alſo written in the ſecond Pſalm, Thou

To this end 'tis to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, 1. That whatſoever is revealed in theſe Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the things that were between God and Chriſt, God ſaid and propounded it unto Chriſt long before his coming in the fleſh, and therefore it muſt needs relate to ſuch tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as were betwixt God and Chriſt in the counſel of his Will from all eternity. 2. Though the accompliſhment of theſe things be applyed by the Holy Ghoſt, unto the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt; <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33, and to the exaltation of him in his humane nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5; that doth not make againſt the tranſacting of them by an eternal Covenant, where firſt theſe Propoſals were made; but on the contrary, it doth ſtreng then what is here aſſerted; becauſe the accompliſhment of theſe things is declared to be that which God had revealed in the old Teſtament to have been ſaid long before by him to Chriſt. Therefore alſo the ſame Scripture is brought as an evidence of Chriſt's being conſecrated by his Father unto the offices which he did bear for the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beſides the Scriptures before-mentioned, we read alſo of God's Propoſals to Chriſt, concerning the work of man's Redemption, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, 7, <hi>I the Lord have called thee in Righteouſneſs, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the people for a light of the Gentiles. To open the eyes of the blind, to bring out the priſoners from the priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs out of the priſon-houſe.</hi> And 49.5, 6, <hi>And now ſaith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his ſervant, to bring Jacob again to him; though Iſrael be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength. And he ſaid, it is a light thing that thou ſhouldſt be my ſervant, to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael. I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my ſalvation to the ends of the earth,</hi> &amp;c. which things no man can reaſonably doubt to be ſpoken by <hi>Jehovah</hi> to Chriſt, and to contain Propoſals concerning the Redemption and Salvation of his elect people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us in the next place conſider, where we find Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proof for Chriſt's conſent unto theſe Propoſals, made by <hi>Jehovah</hi> to him, which amounteth to a Covenant? We find Chriſt's conſent and agreement, and that before the beginning of the world, unto the Propoſals made to him by <hi>Jehovah</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this work of Redemption, and the office which he was called unto for that effect, clearly inſinuated, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, 23, 24, <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was ſet up from everlaſting from the beginning, before ever the earth was. When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no fountains abounding with water.</hi>—30.31, <hi>Then I was by him as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoycing always before him. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58137:19"/>with the Sons of men.</hi> Where we find the ſubſtantial, eternal wiſdom of God, Jeſus Chriſt declaring ſuch a plenary volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary chearful conſent to undertake the work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that when he was in the Counſel of God ſet up and deſigned unto the office and glory of the Lord Mediator and Redeemer; he took pleaſure and ſatisfaction before-hand, not only in his people not yet created, above all the works of his hand, who were to be the ſatisfying ſight that ſhould be given him for the travel of his Soul (as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11.); but he took pleaſure alſo in theſe parts which they were to inhabit, in every bit of ground that was to be <hi>the bounds of their habitation</hi> in the times appointed, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26.</p>
               <p>But yet more explicitely, read his conſent to the Propoſals made by <hi>Jehovah</hi> to his Son Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, 7, 8, <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſire, mine ears haſt thou opened; burnt offering and ſin offering haſt thou not required. Then ſaid I, lo I come; in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.</hi> With <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7, <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith, ſacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me. In burnt offerings and ſacrifices for ſin, thou haſt had no pleaſure. Then ſaid I, lo I come; in the volume of the boook it is written of me, to do thy will, O God.</hi> Concerning theſe Scriptures, let us obſerve ſome things for clearing the point in hand; to wit, Chriſt's conſent and agreement unto Propoſals made to him by <hi>Jehovah.</hi> And 1. It is manifeſt that the words are Chriſt's words; for the Apoſtle makes Chriſt, not <hi>David</hi> to be the ſpeaker here, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith,</hi> i. e. Chriſt ſaith; for it is of Chriſt's ſacrifice, and his offering himſelf that the Apoſtle hath been ſpeaking. 2. 'Tis as manifeſt that Chriſt ſpeaketh theſe words to God, to <hi>Jehovah;</hi> therefore he ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7.9, <hi>O God,</hi> and <hi>O my God.</hi> 3. The words preſuppoſe ſomething ſpoken and propounded by God to Chriſt, unto which theſe words are an anſwer: there are four words in the Text which carry this plainly, that there was ſomething that he, <hi>i. e.</hi> Jehovah <hi>deſired</hi> and <hi>required</hi> as a pleaſing ſatisfaction to him, above all typical Sacrifices, ſomething which Chriſt calls his fathers will and his command, <hi>thy will, O God; thy law,</hi> O God, to which he gave an anſwer, <hi>then I ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. 4. That the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58137:20"/>thing concerning which he makes anſwer to God here, was upon the matter, 1. Some Propoſal, for the performance whereof, God had prepared and fitted him, by his Incarnation and aſſuming our nature; <hi>A body thou haſt prepared me or fitted me;</hi> and by his taking on a will that might bow to the will of God, <hi>Mine ears thou haſt opened.</hi> 2. 'Tis an anſwer to the Propoſal of a buſineſs unto which Chriſt was called, which was the fathers will and command to him, <hi>to do thy will and thy law, O God.</hi> 3. 'Tis an anſwer and return to God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſomething that was concluded and agreed betwixt God and Chriſt before-hand; and therefore is ſaid to be <hi>written in the volume of thy book.</hi> 4. 'Tis ſomething, which however it was contracted and recorded before; yet was not to be fulfilled until the due time, <hi>when he cometh into the world,</hi> not till the time of his Incarnation. 5. 'Tis ſomething that divine Juſtice required for a ſatisfaction, and which no Sacrifices could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount unto; which is held forth in the oppoſition of this command to the negation of all ſatisfaction by other Sacrifices. <hi>Sacrifice thou haſt not required, but,</hi> &amp;c. and this was no other but the obedience of his own Son, and the giving his <hi>Soul an offering</hi> and Sacrifice <hi>for ſin</hi> to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief; when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider the anſwer that Chriſt gives here, how it amounts unto a plenary conſent and agreement unto the will and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of his father unto him, which is a Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Suretiſhip, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he will undertake and do the work of our Redemption, according to his fathers will.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay Chriſt's anſwer bears a conſent, a willing conſent, <hi>Lo I come;</hi> Chriſt ſiſts himſelf before God in readineſs to do his Father's will, to be our Surety and Saviour, 'tis an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion not unlike theſe of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> whereby they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their free conſent and readineſs to obey the call of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.8, <hi>Then ſaid I, here am I, ſend me;</hi> in the Original it is <hi>behold me,</hi> or <hi>lo me;</hi> which is equivolent to <hi>Lo I come;</hi> or I ſiſt my ſelf ready to obey thy command, to do thy will, to run thy errand, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.10, <hi>Speak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth, i. e.</hi> doth ſiſt himſelf ready to obey.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58137:20"/>2. Chriſt's anſwer bears a ſubmiſſive humble conſent, <hi>Mine ear haſt thou opened,</hi> or <hi>bored:</hi> there ſeems to be an alluſion to a Ceremony that was uſed toward the Servant that would not have his liberty, but loved his Maſter ſo, that he would not go out free from his Service, when he might according to Law, in the ſeventh year: whereof ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.12, to 17. &amp; <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.6. So the opening or boring of the ear is, not only a ſign of hearkening and obedience, as the Phraſe is uſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.5, <hi>The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.</hi> But it notes alſo his taking on the form of a Servant, ſuch as had their ears bored, in token of their ſubmiſſion to ſerve when they might have been free. In place of this Phraſe, the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>A body thou haſt prepared me:</hi> giving a perſpicuous interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the opening of the ear, that it related to Chriſt's Incarnation, and the principal end thereof, which was that he might be found in the form of a Servant, to obey and do the will of his father, as one who by his own conſent was nailed and pinned to his Service in the work of Redemption, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8, <hi>But made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men. And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt's anſwer bears a conſent given in contemplation of a ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice; and therefore he mentions <hi>the Law of God,</hi> and the things that God <hi>required,</hi> and offers himſelf to undergo theſe; for this he did propoſe to himſelf, that offended divine Juſtice might have an honourable ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that the Law might have obedience in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, <hi>But when the fulneſs of the time was come, God. ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law: To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the Adoption of ſons.</hi> Zech. 13.7, <hi>Awake, O ſword, againſt my ſhepherd, and againſt the man that is my fellow, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, ſmite the ſhepherd.</hi> Gal. 3.13, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt's anſwer bears a compleat and plenary conſent, which is every way apted unto the Propoſals made to him: for he offers himſelf to fulfil the <hi>Law</hi> (to which he voluntarily ſubjected himſelf) in the exact rigour thereof, <hi>in every thing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58137:21"/>that is written in the bookk of the law,</hi> Gal. 3.10. he offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to perform the utmoſt degree of obedience to the Will of God, <hi>to do thy will, O God;</hi> yea, to do not only according to what is written in the book of the Law, but according to the indenture and contract betwixt God and him, to which I underſtand the <hi>volume of the book</hi> here mentioned, chiefly to relate; ſuppoſing the agreement betwixt God and Chriſt about the work of man's Redemption, and all his undertakings to be written as it were in a Book or Roll, in that ſenſe that the Scripture ſpeaks of a book of life, and the Lambs book of life, and the writings therein, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. &amp; 15.8. &amp; 21.27.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt's anſwer bears a chearful conſent to the Propoſals made by God to him, <hi>I delight to do thy will, O God, and thy law is within my heart;</hi> becauſe his heart was to the buſineſs, and a deſign of love acted him all along his undertaking and performing the work of our Redemption, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1, <hi>having loved his own;</hi> therefore he took pleaſure in the work; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was his delight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31, <hi>Rejoycing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> Luk. 22.15, <hi>And he ſaid unto them, with deſire I have deſired to eat this paſſeover with you before I ſuffer.</hi> I conclude then, that this conſent upon Chriſt's part to his Father's Propoſals, makes a Covenant betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſide the former two, which according to the opinion of <hi>Juriſts</hi> amount to a <hi>Paction,</hi> and a <hi>Contract,</hi> or virtual Covenant, and I think alſo to a formal explicite Covenant: there is alſo veſtiges to be found betwixt God and Chriſt of all things required unto explicite formal Covenanting.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore enquire a little, 1. What are the requiſites of formal explicite Covenanting. 2. What veſtiges of theſe are to be found betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The peculiar propriety of formal explicite Covenanting, ſtands in ſtipulation and reſtipulation, in Conditional Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, commands, tenders, or promiſes upon the one part; and the accepting, conſenting, or performing of conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, upon the other part: When the Propoſals of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever quality and kind they be, are expreſly conditional, and the conditions propounded and required, are expreſly accepted and agreed unto, there is a formal explicite Covenant, even in the moſt ſtrict and rigorous acceptation of the word <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58137:21"/>Hence the <hi>Juriſts</hi> confine mutual contracts and explicite Covenants, within the compaſs of theſe few words, <hi>Do ut des,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Soto de juſtitia &amp; Jure <hi>lib. 6. Queſt. 2. Art. 1.</hi> Jo. Cal. lex Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad. in voce pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; facio ut facias, do ut facias, facio ut des.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That there be clear footſteps of ſuch dealing and Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, may appear from theſe inſtances; all which evince ſtipulation and reſtipulation; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions upon the one part and upon the other; Conditions given and taken.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt there are <hi>Commands with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> holding forth what was the Will of God to Chriſt, in the matter of man's Redemption; and what he ſhould expect from his Father for doing that work, and obeying his Will, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39, 40, <hi>This is the fathers will,—and this is the will of him that ſent me.</hi> Zech. 6.12, 13,—<hi>Behold the man whoſe name is the Branch, and he ſhall grow up out of his place, and he ſhall build the temple of the Lord—and the counſel of peace ſhall be between them both.</hi> Mich. 5.4, 5, <hi>And he ſhall ſtand and feed in the ſtrength of the Lord, in the majeſty of the name of the Lord his God, and they ſhall abide, for now ſhall he be great unto the ends of the earth. And this man ſhall be the peace when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into our land.</hi> Iſa. 42, 1, 2, 3, 4.—<hi>He ſhall bring forth Judgment to the Gentiles. He ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreet. A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and the ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench; he ſhall bring forth Judgment unto truth.</hi> And if a command with a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning annexed, which had a promiſe in it implicitely, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a Covenant in God's dealing with man in his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, by a Covenant of works (as is acknowledged by all Civines); <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17, <hi>But of the tree of the knowledg of good and evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> Sure, commands with explicite promiſes, ſuch as are betwixt God and Chriſt, do amount to a Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, there are <hi>Promiſes with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;</hi> I ſay Promiſes with Conditions (not abſolute promiſes) read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12,—<hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand: He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied. By his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58137:22"/>ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong, becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death, and he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors, and he bare the ſin of many, and made inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Now Promiſes with Conditions, are promiſes with re-promiſſions, or conditions upon the one part, and upon the other; this is a declaration of what God will do, and what he doth require, which is a formal Covenant, and is plainly reducible to that which the <hi>Juriſts</hi> call <hi>Do ut fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias, facio ut des,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, not only Commands with Promiſes annexed, and Promiſes with Conditions annexed; but which is yet more, <hi>Conditions with conſent,</hi> a formal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and voluntary yielding unto the Propoſals which were made unto him by <hi>Jehovah;</hi> and this is without queſtion, a formal explicite Covenant, conſiſting of ſtipulation and reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, propounding and anſwering, or accepting, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yielding or conſenting: he receives a command from his Father to lay down his life, and he willingly conſents, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18, <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my father.</hi> His Father propounds his Will to him, and makes offer of fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and he accepts, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 53.10,—<hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi> Heb. 10.5, 7, <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith, ſacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared me. Then ſaid I, Lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God.</hi> Here is a formal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>Conſenting with Performing;</hi> not only a mutual agreement upon the things to be done by Chriſt, and to be done to Chriſt; but a real perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the mutual conditions agreed upon betwixt them: and this is more than a conſummate Covenant, this is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of an explicite Covenant, and the acknowledgment of both parties, that it was mutually covenanted, and that the conditions were obſerved, and were performed on both ſides:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58137:22"/>
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: and his Father ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth, I have put my ſpirit upon him, and he ſhall bring forth Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Gentilss.</hi> Phil. 2.8, 9, <hi>And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs. Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name.</hi> There is a reciprocation of Covenant-performances.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>asking and giving:</hi> the Father asketh a ſatisfaction to his Juſtice for the ſins of all the Elect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief:</hi> and the ſatisfaction which his Father asked, was, that he ſhould <hi>make his ſoul an offering for ſin:</hi> and Chriſt yieldeth and giveth the ſatisfaction which was asked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, <hi>Lo I come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to do thy will.</hi> Iſa. 53.5, <hi>But he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and he was bruiſed for our iniquities: the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Chriſt asketh of his Father a reward and ſatisfaction for the travel of his Soul in that great work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation: And his Father gives it him according to the encouraging-Propoſals, whereby he had invited him to the undertaking ſo great a work, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8, <hi>Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> Iſa. 53.11, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> Joh. 17.4, 5, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do: And now, O father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi> This kind of asking and giving on both ſides, amounteth to a formal explicite Covenant: here is <hi>emptio &amp; venditio,</hi> which is a Covenant ſtrictly ſo called.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>work and wages:</hi> there is working propounded upon the one part, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken upon the other; and a reward promiſed upon the one part, and expected upon the other; craved upon the one part, and payed upon the other; and this is a formal Covenant ſtrictly ſo taken, <hi>Ad ſimilitudinem contractus inter operarium &amp; locato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem operis—inter herum &amp; ſervum,</hi> not unlike the manner of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58137:23"/>Covenants betwixt the work-man and work-maſter, betwixt the Servant and his Lord. Here is indeed, <hi>do ut faoias, facio ut des,</hi> I give this upon condition you do that, and I do this upon condition you give that.</p>
               <p>I fay, there was working and rewarding 'twixt God and Chriſt, and that by no neceſſity of nature, but by a voluntary compact; his work and reward are both propounded to him, Iſa. 53.11, 12, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied: by his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant justifie many; for he ſhall bear their iniquity. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong, becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death, and he was numbred with the tranſgreſſours, and he bare the ſin of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſours.</hi> And 49.3, 6, <hi>And ſaid unto me, Thou art my ſervant, O Iſrael, in whom I will be glorified. And he ſaid, it is a light thing that thou ſhouldſt be my ſervant to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael: I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou maiſt be my ſalvation unto the end of the earth.</hi> And agreed unto by him, Joh. 10.17, <hi>Therefore doth my father love me, becauſe I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</hi> Heb. 10.7, <hi>Then ſaid I, lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God.</hi> Therefore we find upon the one part and the other, God promiſing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and Chriſt expecting it: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12, <hi>Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great,</hi> with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4, <hi>Surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God.</hi> Again, we find God propoſing the reward for Chriſt's encouragement in ſo hard a work, and Chriſt eying the reward under all diſcouragements, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.7, <hi>He ſhall drink of the brook in the way, therefore ſhall he lift up the head;</hi> with <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, <hi>Looking unto Jeſus the Author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> We find alſo Chriſt craving his reward, and challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as due to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> And his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paying the promiſed reward, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9, <hi>Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fourth Proof of a Covenant betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58137:23"/>I take from the <hi>Offices, Imployments, Truſts, Powers, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and Relations,</hi> which Chriſt did bear, and wherewith he was veſted for doing the work of his peoples Redemption: All and every of theſe prove ſtrongly an eternal Covenant and Compact betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt: I put theſe together, that the proofs may be more ponderous than numerous; I ſhall therefore, 1. Reckon up ſome particulars that fall under this head, each whereof might afford a particular proof, and then draw an argument from them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Offices and Employments; Chriſt is Lord <hi>Mediator of the New Covenant,</hi> Heb. 8.6, &amp; 9.15. He is Lord Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and <hi>Meſſenger of the Covenant,</hi> Mal. 3.1. He is the Lord's <hi>Shepherd</hi> and his <hi>Servant</hi> in the work of Redemption, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. Not by nature, but by condeſcenſion and agreement, to be in theſe employments. Chriſt Mediator is a <hi>King,</hi> not by nature but by Covenant and Agreement, he receives a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory Kingdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6, <hi>Yet have I ſet my king upon my holy hill Zion.</hi> Act. 2.36, <hi>God hath made the ſame Jeſus both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> Heb. 1.2,—<hi>whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the worlds.</hi> Pſal. 89.27, <hi>Alſo I will make him my firſt born, higher than the kings of the earth.</hi> Chriſt is a Prophet and a Teacher of his people, not by nature but by appointment, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, <hi>For Moſes truly ſaid unto the Fathers, a Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your brethren like unto me, him ſhall ye hear in all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhall ſay unto you.</hi> Iſa. 55.4, <hi>Behold, I have given him for a witneſs to the people.</hi> Chriſt is a Prieſt not by nature, but by divine appointment, and that in the way of agreement and conſent, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6, <hi>And no man taketh this honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an high prieſt; but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. As he ſaith alſo in another place; Thou art a prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> And 7.21,—<hi>The Lord ſware and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The like I ſay of the Truſts, Powers, and Authorities, that Chriſt Mediator had, concerning the work of his peoples Redemption; how came his name to be in our bond, and he to take upon him to perform the condition of the Covenant of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58137:24"/>works? how came he to be under the Law, and to fulfil the Law? Sure it was not by nature, nor by any neceſſity of nature; but by divine appointment, and by his own voluntary yielding to it, which is Compact; ſo <hi>Jeſus was made ſurety,</hi> Heb. 7.22; and <hi>made under the law,</hi> Gal. 4.4; how came he to have the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the eternal intereſts of all men? Sure he had this truſt and authority by agreement with his Father, who laid it upon him, and he freely received it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, for the <hi>Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son:</hi> &amp; 17.2, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> How came the keys of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> to lye upon his ſhoulder? the great truſt and management of all affairs relating to his Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? undoubtedly this was by Compact with <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who laid this truſt upon him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.23, 24, <hi>And the key of the houſe of David will I lay upon his ſhoulder, ſo he ſhall open and none ſhall ſhut, and he ſhall ſhut and none ſhall open. And I will faſten him as a nail in a ſure place, and he ſhall be for a glorious throne to his fathers houſe. And they ſhall hang upon him all the glory of his houſe, the offspring and the iſſue, all veſſels of ſmall quantity, from the veſſels of cups, even to all the veſſels of flagons.</hi> Rev. 3.7.—<hi>He that hath the key of David, he that openeth and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no man openeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I affirm the ſame alſo of Chriſt's Covenant-relations to God and to his people: Though God the Father was the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt by eternal generation, and he is the natural Son of God; yet who can declare how God is <hi>the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but by Covenant? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. God foretold this Covenant-Intereſt of Chriſt's, Pſal. 89.26, <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of my Salvation;</hi> with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5, <hi>For unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. And again, I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son.</hi> And Chriſt frequently owns that Covenant-compellation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> Rev. 3.12, <hi>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the City of my God, which is new Jeruſalem, which cometh down out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from my God, and I will write upon him my new name.</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:58137:24"/>Joh. 20.17, <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto her, touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father; but go to my brethren and ſay to them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which I draw but this one Argument; Chriſt who did bear all theſe offices, employments, truſts and relations, for the work of our Redemption, he had all theſe things (I ſay) either by ſome neceſſity that could not ſtand with his own free conſent; or elſe he did bear theſe offices, employments, truſts and relations by his own willing conſent, and they were of his own voluntary taking up. Now 'tis ſure he was not Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, nor Surety, nor Meſſenger of the Covenant, nor a ſervant in that affair, by any neceſſity that was repugnant to his own free conſnt. I ſay no neceſſity that was repugnant to his own free conſent; becauſe there was, 1. Some kind of neceſſity that Chriſt ſhould travel in this work, in regard of the DEcree of God, and Divine Predetermination, that a ſatisfaction ſhould be made unto his Juſtice, and that man ſhould not be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this ſatisfaction interveening; which decree is in order of nature, and in that kind of priority, that is in our way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of God's eternal decrees, antecedaneous to God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Chriſt: Therefore the Scripture giveth us ground to ſay, that God firſt choſe Chriſt to this work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then made a Covenant with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.3, <hi>I have made a Covenant with my choſen.</hi> 2. We find that Chriſt having taken upon him theſe offices, truſts, employments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, was under a bleſſed, holy neceſſity, to fulfil the things belonging to his offices and truſts; and therefore the Scripture ſaith, <hi>it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren,</hi> Heb. 2.17. and <hi>it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer,</hi> Luk. 24.46. <hi>and he muſt needs go thorow Samaria,</hi> Joh. 4.4. <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me,</hi> Joh. 9.4. But neither of theſe neceſſities was any ways repugnant to his own free confent and willingneſs to bear theſe offices and truſts: For the firſt neceſſity in regard of the decree of God, that decree being the counſel of his own will, as well as his Fathers; there was not thereby any neceſſity upon him, repugnant to his own free conſent. And the ſecond neceſſity of doing the works of him that ſent him, being a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity which he voluntarily took upon him by his willing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the truſt of being Lord Mediator, there was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58137:25"/>any impoſing upon his free conſent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</hi> Phil. 2.8, <hi>And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf unto death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I ſay, there was not upon Chriſt any neceſſity repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to his free and willing acting, in the taking upon him theſe offices, truſts, relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. Becauſe there was no <hi>compelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſity,</hi> ſuch as is upon a man bound hand and foot; there was no ſuch neceſſity upon the Lord to ſend Chriſt, and to lay theſe offices upon him; for he is a moſt free foveraign Agent, above counſel, and much more above compulſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.13, <hi>Who hath directed the ſpirit of the Lord, or being his Counſellour hath taught him?</hi> Pſal. 135.6, <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that did he in heaven and in earth, in the ſeas, and all deep place.</hi> And he was not bound to change the Law-diſpenſation into a new one of Grace; Therefore is the thing that was laid upon Chriſt, ſo often called <hi>the will of him that ſent him,</hi> Joh. 6.39, 40. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any ſuch neceſſity upon Chriſt to take theſe offices and employments, he could not be compelled to lay down his life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18, <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again; this Commandment received I of my Father.</hi> Phil. 2.6.8, <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There was no <hi>natural ueceſſity,</hi> ſuch as that of the Sun to give light, and the fire heat; ſure there was no ſuch neceſſity of God's ſending of Chriſt; God did not by any natural neceſſity ſend forth Chriſt; nor was the Son of God under any natural neceſſity to undertake the work of our Redemption, for God might have done otherwiſe, he might in Juſtice have proſecuted the Covenant of works; yea, there was no kind of neceſſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God to ſend, or upon Chriſt to go this errand, abſtracting from his own Decrees, and the purpoſe of his Will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 6, <hi>Having predeſtinated us unto the adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will: to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the beloved.</hi> Rom. 9.20, 21, <hi>Nay, but O man, who
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58137:25"/>art thou, that replyeſt againſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou formed me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel unto honour, and another unto diſhonour?</hi> 3. There was no <hi>moral neceſſity,</hi> not ſo much as any command, motive or inducement without himſelf, either upon God to lay this employment upon Chriſt, or upon Chriſt to take it upon him, and to undergo the work; for God might have ſent his Son or not ſent him, as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him; there was not ſo much as a moral cauſe inducing him to it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, <hi>For God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Rom. 5.6, 8, <hi>For when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly. But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> And Chriſt might have refuſed to undertake the work, or he might have agreed as pleaſed him; for who could have laid a command upon him, if the deſign of love that was in his heart had not acted him to a conſent? <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 8, <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> It reſts therefore that all theſe offices, employments, truſts, authorities, and Covenant-relations, that Chriſt did bear, were undertaken and undergone by his own free conſent; and if they were by his free conſent, this conſent was either his own motion without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and agreement of <hi>Jehovah</hi> concurring in councel with him, for the carrying on the work of our Redemption; or this was tranſacted and done in the counſel of God, by the knowledg, will, conſent and agreement of God with Chriſt. Now the Scripture is plain and expreſs, that all the offices, truſts, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, employments and Covenant-relations which Chriſt did bear, were not uſurped, were not taken upon him without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordination and appointment, without his Father's conſent and command; but that he was deſigned, choſen and called thereunto. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23, <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</hi> Joh. 5.22, <hi>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.</hi> Iſa. 42.1, 6, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold; I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſs.</hi> And 49.1, 3,—<hi>The Lord hath called me from the womb, from the bowels of my mother hath
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58137:26"/>he made mention of my name.—Thou art my ſervant, O Iſrael, in whom I will be glorified.</hi> Heb. 5.5, 6, <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an high prieſt; but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. As he ſaith alſo in another place, Thou art a prieſt for ever, after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec.</hi> Act. 3.26, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning away every one from his iniquities.</hi> Pſal. 40.6, <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, mine ears haſt thou opened; burnt offering and ſin offering haſt thou not required,</hi> &amp;c. I conclude therefore, that all theſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, truſts, powers, and Covenant-relations which Chriſt did bear, being upon him by mutual agreement and conſent betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt; all and every one of them doth prove a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact and Covenant betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>He who deſireth more proofs of this Covenant, and to have, further light therein; let him read <hi>Jo. Cocc. Summa doctrinae de foedere,</hi> ch. 5. and Mr. <hi>Rutherf. Treat. of the Covenant,</hi> Part 2. ch. 6. And <hi>Fr. Robert</hi>'s, <hi>Gods Covenants with Man,</hi> Book 2. ch. 2. Sect. 3.</p>
               <p>Now that this Covenant betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, was the foundation of the Covenant made with us, may be evinced by theſe particulars. 1. If this Covenant of Suretiſhip had not been concluded betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, there could never have been any Covenant-dealing with us upon terms of Grace; for ſuppoſe this Covenant had not been, the Lord ſhould then have proſecuted the Covenant of works, and followed a courſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt all Mankind, the dore ſhould have been ſhut for ever againſt all condeſcenſions, and all Goſpel ways of Grace. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find the Apoſtle reckons the change of Law-diſpenſation, and life by the tenor of the Covenant of works, into a new way of Grace, to have its foundation, original and riſe from Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious eternal tranſaction with Chriſt. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, <hi>Who hath ſaved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. God's Covenant-dealing with us upon the terms of Grace, is nothing elſe but the execution of that which was from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty decreed, tranſacted and concluded by God's Compact with Chriſt; and therefore the Covenant of Suretiſhip muſt needs be the foundation of the Covenant with us, even as all Decrees
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58137:26"/>and Laws are the foundation of the execution following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: this will appear more fully and clearly when we come to ſpeak of the tenor of the Covenant of Redemption, and the things therein tranſacted: at preſent this may ſuffice, 1. That whatſoever Covenant-favour and Grace is tendered to us by the Goſpel-Covenant, and effectually applyed unto us by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord, that was promiſed to Chriſt, and to us in him; yea, and plighted in him for our account by the Covenant made betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and him; as appears from the Scripture before-mentioned, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9,—<hi>According to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt before the world began;</hi> with Tit. 1.2, <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before the world began.</hi> 2. Whatſoever Covenant-Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of one kind or another; whether Faith, the eminent Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-condition, or other Goſpel-obedience required of us, or to be performed upon our part; all theſe were undertaken by Chriſt's act of Suretiſhip in the Covenant betwixt God and him, and were enſured to him by <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to be ſucceſsfully performed. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10, <hi>For we are his workmanſhip crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.13, <hi>But we are bound to give thanks alway to God, for you brethren, beloved of the Lord; becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you to Salvation, through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth.</hi> Iſa. 53.11,—<hi>And the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied; by his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In perſonal Covenanting with God, and the engaging of particular Souls to him, in the way of the Covenant of Grace; Chriſt's Suretiſhip is the ground of all proceeding: till this be eyed, and in ſome meaſure believed, there is no poſſibility of advancing one ſtep toward a new Covenant-ſtate: for how can fallen broken man (who underſtands his condition to be ſuch) think of dealing with God, unleſs he bring a Cautioner with him; or how ſhall he bring to God <hi>Chriſt, a ſurety of the better teſtament,</hi> who hath not heard of and believed his eternal act of Suretiſhip, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, <hi>How then ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a preacher?</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:58137:27"/>This Covenant of Surtiſhip therefore muſt needs be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace and reconciliation; hence 'tis that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> flee to this act of Suretiſhip, and lay the weight of their dealing with God on it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.122, <hi>Be ſurety for thy ſervant for good.</hi> Iſa. 38.14,—<hi>O Lord, I am op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, undertake for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Covenant made with us, hath its ſtability from the Covenant of Suretiſhip made with Chriſt, and therefore this muſt be the foundation of that; I ſay, upon the ſtability of the Covenant made with Chriſt, doth depend the ſtability of the Covenant with us; becauſe that ſtands firm and ſure, therefore doth this ſtand faſt alſo; therefore the mercies of the Covenant with us, are <hi>ſure mercies,</hi> and the promiſes of the Covenant are <hi>yea, and amen;</hi> becauſe they are <hi>the ſure mercies of David,</hi> which were firſt promiſed to Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. and becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were made to us <hi>in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20, <hi>For all the promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him are amen.</hi> Therefore the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with us is an everlaſting Covenant, becauſe of the Covenant by which he was given to his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3, 4, <hi>I make with you an everlaſting Covenant, even the ſure mercies of David. Behold I have given him for a witneſs of the people, a leader and commander of the people:</hi> therefore our faith, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, and ſalvation are ſure, as ſure as Heaven and Earth can make them, becauſe of the act of Chriſt's Suretiſhip, and his undertaking for them; becauſe they hang upon Chriſt's fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Covenant of Suretiſhip with God, and upon condition of his doing the work that his Father gave him to do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, 8.15.24, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do:—For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them.—I pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the world; but that thou ſhouldſt keep them from the evil—Father I will, that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi> Mat. 16.18,—<hi>And upon this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Holy Ghoſt's leading us ſo frequently in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from the Covenant made with us, in all the force, efficacy, ſtability, eternity, ſtanding, and perſeverance thereof, to look up to the Covenant of Suretiſhip made with Chriſt; is a clear demonſtration that this Covenant made with us
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58137:27"/>depends upon the Covenant made with him; and that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with Chriſt, is the foundation and ground of the Covenant made with us. Read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.60, 61, <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I will remember my Covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will eſtabliſh unto thee an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Then thou ſhalt remember thy ways, and be aſhamed, when thou ſhalt receive thy Sisters, thine elder, and thy younger, and I will give them unto thee for daughters; but not by thy Covenant.</hi> Where the efficacy of the Covenant made with us, is hanged, not upon that ſame Covenant, but another; to wit, that made with Chriſt: And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.22, 23, <hi>And the key of the houſe of David will I lay upon his ſhoulder; for he ſhall open, and none ſhall ſhut, and he ſhall ſhut and none ſhall open; and I will faſten him as a nail in a ſure place, and he ſhall be for a glorious throne to his father's houſe,</hi> &amp;c. Where under a type of <hi>Eliakim</hi>'s truſt, the fixing of Chriſt in the Covenant is ſtated, as the ground of all the gracious efficiency thereof; and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.33, 34, <hi>Nevertheleſs my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail. My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I ſworn by my holineſs, that I will not lye unto David.</hi> The eſtabliſhment of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Chriſt's ſinful ſeed (there ſpoke of by the name of <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed), is reduced to the Covenant, the ſworn Covenant with Chriſt, as the ground and foundation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whom God laid in <hi>Zion</hi> for a <hi>ſure foundation,</hi> to the intent that <hi>he who believeth may not make haſte,</hi> nor be ſuddenly removed from his Faith and ſteadfaſtneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16.</p>

               <p>WHen we ſpeak of the neceſſity of the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption or Suretiſhip, we are cautiouſly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that neceſſity. The <hi>School-men</hi> diſtinguiſh a threefold neceſſity.<note place="margin">Aquin. <hi>Sum.</hi> 1. <hi>Part. g.</hi> 19. <hi>Art.</hi> 3 Eſtius <hi>in Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> li. 1. d. 38. Sect. 7.</note> 1. <hi>A moſt perfect and abſolute neceſſity,</hi> or a <hi>ſimple neceſſity,</hi> when a thing is ſo, that it cannot not be, nor be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and that by the power of any Agent whatſoever. This neceſſity belongeth not to the Covenant of Redemption, nor to any other the free acts of the will of God; for if ſo it had pleaſed God, he might have not entered that Covenant with his Son; for it was not abſolutely neceſſary that man ſhould be redeemed: God might have paſſed by man as he did the Apoſtate Angels; which choice of objects, to be redeemed by Chriſt, is mentioned for aggravating God's love to man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16, <hi>For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels; but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This neceſſity belongs only to the divine Nature, which is moſt perfect, and cannot by any Agent whatſoever, be brought not to be; or to be other, or otherwiſe than he is, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17, —<hi>with whom is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning.</hi> 2. A <hi>natural neceſſity,</hi> when any thing floweth <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>meerly</hi> from the principles of nature; and thus the fire burneth, and the ſtone deſcendeth. Now the Covenant of Redemption is not neceſſary by this natural neceſſity; for God did not enter in Covenant with Chriſt as the fire burns, neceſſarily, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; for, 1. Then it had been impoſſible for God not to have ſhewed mercy upon fallen man, and that in this very way of Redemption by Chriſt; for natural Agents cannot but act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their natural properties; but it is manifeſt from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58137:28"/>God's paſſing by the fallen Angels, that he might have paſſed by man alſo in his ſinful ſtate. 2. If God had either purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in himſelf, or exerciſed juſtice or mercy, or both (which is inconſiſtent, implicant, and impoſſible) by this natural neceſſity, then (his juſtice and mercy being infinite) he ſhould have ſhewed mercy up on all, or exerciſed juſtice upon all; he ſhould either have puniſhed all that ſinned to the utmoſt, as ſoon as they had ſinned, or he ſhould have ſhewed mercy upon all, as ſoon as there were qualified objects for mercy: the reaſon is obvious, becauſe all natural Agents work to the utmoſt they can. 3. Then there ſhould have been no Compact nor Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt; for ſuppoſing ſuch a natural neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we deſtroy free conſent and agreement, which is eſſential to this Covenant, and is proved in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an <hi>hypothetical neceſſity</hi> which ariſeth from God's ordination and appointment; or as others call it, a <hi>neceſſity of conſequence;</hi> when any thing is neceſſary upon ſuppoſition of ſome other thing; and this is not an abſolute neceſſity in the things themſelves, and their immutability; but a <hi>limited reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> neceſſity, upon connexion of one thing with another. Again, this limited reſpective neceſſity (as Mr. <hi>Anth. Burgeſs</hi> well obſerves) is ſometimes from the efficient cauſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>True Doctrine of Juſtif.</hi> Part 2. Serm. 11.</note> becauſe he is thus and thus diſpoſed; as when 'tis ſaid, <hi>there must be hereſies,</hi> 1 Cor. 11, 29. That is, partly in regard of the efficient cauſe (although the Text mentioneth there only the final cauſe), becauſe there will be Ignorance and Pride always in men. 2. From the material cauſe: Thus death is neceſſary and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, becauſe we have principles of corruptibility within us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the formal cauſe, becauſe that is immutable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. 4. From the final cauſe ſuppoſing ſuch an end.</p>
               <p>When we ſpeak of the neceſſity of the Covenant of Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or Redemption, it is this third and laſt kind of neceſſity we mean; it was hypothetically and reſpectively neceſſary only that God ſhould enter in Covenant with Chriſt; to wit, upon ſuppoſition of ſome other thing that God had decreed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in himſelf. And here let us a little enquire,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What were theſe things which God's entering in Covenant with Chriſt doth ſuppoſe? 2. What was the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a Covenant betwixt God and Chriſt, ſuppoſing theſe things? 3. Whether this hypothetical and reſpective neceſſity
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58137:29"/>of a Covenant with Chriſt, flowed only from the final cauſe, from the ends which God had purpoſed in himſelf, or from the efficient cauſe alſo, that is, from God's natural propenſion to Juſtice or Mercy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Covenant of Redemption wherein God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with Chriſt, did proceed upon ſuppoſition of theſe things mainly (I do not ſay only, nor do I determine the order of the things ſuppoſed). 1. This Covenant ſuppoſeth that God had purpoſed in himſelf, and decreed eminently to glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the way of juſtice and mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23, <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction? And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory?</hi> 2 This Covenant ſuppoſeth that God had purpoſed and decreed, that there ſhould be objects qualified, and fit for the glorifying of both theſe Attributes; and this was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to that purpoſe, both <hi>quoad exercitium &amp; quoad ſpecificationem actus,</hi> in reſpect of the exerciſe of the act and the ſpecification and manner of it. For to ſome properties in God there is required no object, and to others no qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the object. To God's Omnipotency there is required no object, becauſe it makes its objects; and to God's Wiſdom there is required no qualification in the object; for he can order every thing to a glorious end. Yet to God's mercy and juſtice, <hi>ad extra,</hi> there are not only required objects, but objects ſo qualified, either with Grace or Sin, as Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> obſerves. Therefore the Covenant of Redemption doth ſuppoſe the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and decree of God about the creation of man, in a bleſſed, but mutable ſtate,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct. of Juſtif.</hi> p. 1. p. 105. &amp; p. 2. p. 105.</note> and his fall from his Primitive bleſſedneſs and firſt Covenant-ſtate, into Sin; that there might be objects and qualified objects for glorifying the Attributes of mercy and juſtice, upon which the Apoſtle in the place before-mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23. calls <hi>veſſels of mercy,</hi> and <hi>veſſels of wrath.</hi> 3. The Covenant of Redemption ſuppoſeth God's purpoſe and free decree, ſo far to follow his Covenant-truth and juſtice upon man, as not to acquit him without a ſatisfaction to Juſtice in his own perſon, or by a ſurety of the ſame kind that ſinned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, that by means of death for the redemption of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58137:29"/>tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt teſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of the eternal Inheritance.</hi> 4. The Covenant of Redemption ſuppoſeth that God had purpoſed to have in Makind the objects for plorifying both theſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of mercy and juſtice, that he would not puniſh all ſin with eternal death; nor yet let all go unpuniſhed; but would manifeſt his juſtice in ſome objects, and the riches of his Grace in others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23. 5. The Covenant of Redemption ſuppoſeth that God had choſen Chriſt firſt to do the work of Redemption, by ſatisfying juſtice, and entreating mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.3, <hi>I have made a Covenant with my choſen.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people.</hi> And that he had choſen the veſſels of mercy in him, unto grace and glory, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, 5, <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love. Having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of children, by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> I ſay then, <hi>his ſuppoſitis,</hi> theſe and ſuch like things being ſuppoſed, God enters in a Covenant with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. But ſuppoſing that it is decreed, that divine juſtice ſhall be ſatisfied; and that the truth of the threatning of the Covenant of works, ſhould be verified upon man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, or upon a ſufficient ſurety: ſuppoſing alſo that Chriſt is deſigned in the counſel of God unto this work of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt man, by performing a ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God: It is yet a queſtion, What needed the Covenant of Redemption or Suretiſhip betwixt God and Chriſt? Might not the work have been done without any Compact, Covenant or Agreement betwixt the Father and the Son?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall only here give a ſhort anſwer, referring the more full and particular ſatisfaction of this queſtion unto the latter part of this Chapter, wherein I have purpoſed the handling of the particular ends and intents for which the Covenant of Redemption is neceſſary; For preſent I ſay, 1. It might ſuffice that God decreed, and plainly revealed that the ſatisfaction which his juſtice will have for ſin, and which Chriſt has given, was agreed betwixt them by a Covenant: and ſo in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58137:30"/>reſpect of infinite wiſdom, which worketh by deep counſel, and doth nothing without a reaſon, it was neceſſary; becauſe God thought fit that it ſhould be ſo, he pitched upon this way. But beſide this, 2. Whatſoever neceſſity was in regard of infinite wiſdom, that loſt man ſhould be redeemed, ſin ſhould not be pardoned without a ſatisfaction, that Chriſt ſhould be our Redeemer, and ſhould come and give that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: the ſame neceſſity alſo requires a Covenant betwixt God and Chriſt, for carrying on that work in the way of Agreement; ſo that if a Mediator, a Saviour and Redeemer, a Surety, a ranſom were neceſſary, in regard of infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which found out this Goſpel-diſpenſation and new way of life, then was a Covenant of Suretiſhip and Redemption neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary alſo in the ſame reſpect. 3. The work of Redemption performed by Chriſt, was ſuch as could not be undertaken and performed without a Covenant; for it required commanding and obeying, ſending and going, asking and receiving, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rewarding, all which import, and ſuppoſe ſuperiority and inferiority, or ſubordination, which could not be betwixt the Father and the Son, who is <hi>equal with God,</hi> Phil. 2.6, unleſs that by Agreement, Compact, Conſent and Covenant, the Son of God had <hi>humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2.8. The work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto which Chriſt was deſigned in the counſel of God, required ſeveral offices, employments, truſts, and relations to be ſuſtained by him (whereof I hinted ſomething in the foregoing Chapter) which not being eſſential to the Son of God, nor belonging to him by any natural, abſolute, or immutable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; upon ſuppoſal of the decree of God, that the Son ſhould do the work of Redemption, there was a neceſſity of Conſequence, that there ſhould be a Covenant of Redemption and Suretiſhip; that by the Father's calling and command, and by the Sons conſent and agreement, making up a voluntary Compact, the Son of God might bear theſe offices, and truſts, and relations, which otherwiſe he ſhould not have born, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1.6, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth.—I the Lord have called thee in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and will hold thine hand.</hi> Pſal. 2.7, <hi>I will declare the decree, the Lord hath ſaid unto me, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> Heb. 5.5, 6, <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified not

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Whether did this Hypothetical neceſſity of God's entering in Covenant with Chriſt to pay a ranſom; or as others ſpeak, this neceſſity of conſequence, flow only from a finall cauſe; to wit, God's ends which he purpoſed in himſelf; or from the efficient cauſe alſo; to wit, from juſtice in God that could not remit ſin without ſatisfaction?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Concerning the neceſſity of God's covenanting with Chriſt, in reſpect of the ends which he purpoſed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; there is no queſtion: Which were, 1. The ſupream end, to glorifie his mercy and juſtice; I mean his declarative glory, that ſhines <hi>ad extra;</hi> not the eſſential glory of God, whereby he was infinitely glorious from eternity, and ſhould eternally be eſſentially glorious, though neither Man nor Angel, nor any other object of his glory had been created. This is the glory ſpoken of in theſe Scriptures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4, <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf; yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</hi> Eph. 1.6, <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> 2. The ſubordinate end (which alſo is a <hi>medium</hi> or means for advancing the ſupream end) the Redemption and Salvation of his elect people, to be brought about in ſuch manner as might manifeſt and declare the glory of juſtice and mercy both, in ſaving ſome, not all, and paſſing by others, upon whom he had purpoſed to declare his juſtice; and in ſaving theſe whom he purpoſed to redeem, in ſuch a way as juſtice might be ſatisfied, and mercy alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Eph. 1.7, <hi>In whom we have Redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins according to the riches of his grace.</hi> It is manifeſt, I ſay, that in regard of theſe great ends, the Covenant of Redemption made with Chriſt was neceſſary; God having purpoſed in procuring our Salvation, to glorifie his mercy and juſtice, a Mediator and Surety behoved to be engaged; and there being (in regard of infinite wiſdom which determined it) none ſo fit as the Son of God; he muſt needs be engaged by his own conſent, and by a Covenant-agreement with <hi>Jehovah.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> But here is the queſtion about the neceſſity of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Suretiſhip in regard of the efficient cauſe; to wit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not there was any neceſſity of nature or natural eſſential juſtice in God, which required this way of Suretiſhip and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption neceſſarily, in regard that he could not pardon ſin without a ſatisfaction?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Concerning this queſtion, two reaſons mainly prevail with me to be ſparing in the agitation of it.<note place="margin">Piſc. amica col. cum vorſt.

               <p>Again, there are others that hold, if God be confidered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in regard of his power, and not upon a ſuppoſition of this decree, which is <hi>de facto,</hi> to let no ſin go unpuniſhed; but to puniſh it either in the Perſon, or in his Surety: In this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſenſe they ſay God might freely have remitted ſin without any ſatisfaction.<note place="margin">

               <p>Others again have followed a middle way, and by ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions have ſtudied to reconcile the difference; which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they reach the end or not, yet have ſhewed a good ſpirit in the endeavours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it ſeems the leſs uſeful to diſpute about the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of another way of taking away ſin, and ſatisfying the curſe of the Law, ſince whatſoever God might have done, yet he hath plainly revealed that he hath decreed and pitched upon this only way,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Burg.</hi> True Doct. of Juſtif. <hi>p. 2. p. 104, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> that he will not pardon ſin without a price and ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>For my own poor apprehenſions of this point; 1. I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Socinian</hi> opinion in this matter as extream, and of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence; for they deny Juſtice and Mercy to be Properties or Attributes of God, making Juſtice (or as they call it, Anger) no property in God; but the meer voluntary effect of his Will; denying any ſuch Juſtice in God, whereby he propends to puniſh ſin, and making it wholly arbitrary, to puniſh, or not to puniſh. Upon this foundation they build, that Chriſt did not die by way of ſatisfaction; at leaſt there was no neceſſity of it:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> &amp; p. 1. p. 107, &amp;c.</note> The arguments uſed by Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> in confutation of the <hi>Socinian</hi> opinion, are thus far cogent, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58137:31"/>they conclude juſtice to be a natural property in God (under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the word <hi>natural</hi> for that which floweth from nature; yet by the help of free will); and that God's puniſhing of ſin, is not meerly from his Will. And indeed the Scriptures which hold forth ſin, as not only contrary to God's holy Law, but alſo contrary to his holy Nature: I mean <hi>morally</hi> contrary to him, though not <hi>phyſically,</hi> Heb. 1.13, <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity:</hi> and which attribute the puniſhing of ſin, not only to the juſtice of his Law, but to the righteouſneſs and juſtice of his Nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.7, <hi>For the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, his countenance doth behold the upright.</hi> Rev. 16.5, <hi>And I heard the Angel of the waters ſay, Thou art righteous, O Lord.</hi> Theſe alſo which reckon punitive juſtice among his attributes, when his name was proclaimed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7,—<hi>and that will by no means clear the guilty.</hi> Thefe Scriptures and the like (I ſay) have weight with me to reckon juſtice among the properties of God, and to believe that his puniſhing ſin is not meerly from his will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is another extream, to infer hence, that becauſe juſtice is in ſome ſenſe a natural property in God, and his puniſhing of ſin is not meerly from his will; therefore God puniſheth ſin by neceſſity of nature, and cannot but puniſh it, or require ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, more than he can deny his own Nature, or ceaſe to be God. Againſt this aſſertion,<note place="margin">Treat. of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. <hi>p. 1. c. 7.</hi>
                  </note> the Reaſons brought by Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> (to which I refer the Reader) do ſtrongly conclude.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I conceive that theſe extreams may admit of abatement, without prejudice to the Lord's Soveraignty, and the abſolute freeneſs of his grace, or without derogation from the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt, and the reſpective neceſſity thereof. For, 1. Suppoſing that God doth not puniſh ſin by any natural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and that he doth not puniſh ſin, nor require any ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by any neceſſity of juſtice; yet this can be no advantage to the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſuperſtruction, who conclude that then there was no neceſſity of Chriſt's dying by way of ſatisfaction, ſince God hath plainly revealed that he will not pardon ſin, without a ſatisfaction and an attonement made; and this decree of his doth infer an hypothetical neceſſity of Chriſt's dying by way of ſatisfaction. 2. Suppoſing that juſtice, <hi>punitive juſtice,</hi> be natural to God, and among his properties, it will not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58137:32"/>follow (upon ſuppoſition of the being of ſin) that God puniſheth ſin by neceſſity of Nature and Juſtice, more than it will follow, that becauſe 'tis natural to man to ſpeak, to laugh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore he ſpeaks, he laughs from neceſſity of nature; for he doth theſe things moſt freely; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is natural to him to laugh or ſpeak, he might notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding never laugh nor ſpeak, as pleaſeth him. For if ſo, 1. Then his juſtice ſhould carry him to puniſh ſin without any moderation; that is, to puniſh ſin as ſoon as ever it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to puniſh ſin to the utmoſt degree of puniſhment, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſin in every Soul that ſinneth, without mercy ſhewed to any, and in the ſame Soul that ſinneth, not in a Surety; becauſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Agents work to the utmoſt they can. 2. Becauſe the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral properties of God, as they are eſſential to him, do not ſo much as require any objects <hi>ad extra</hi> (though the manifeſtation of theſe do require objects), for God ſhould have been infinitely and eternally wiſe, holy, good, juſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though there had never been any creation of Men or Angels; and if theſe do not neceſſarily require objects, then far leſs exerciſe of acts; ſo that it will not follow, if Juſtice be natural to God, then he muſt puniſh ſin by neceſſity of Nature. 3. If we ſhall place juſtice among theſe properties in God, the objects whereof may be ſaid to be neceſſary (which muſt be underſtood in reſpect of the exerciſe of acts about theſe objects; otherwiſe no natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in God neceſſarily requires any object <hi>ad extra</hi>); yet the objects ſuppoſed, the acts are not, even then neceſſary by any abſolute neceſſity of nature; but only by a hypothetical neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; ſuppoſing the decree of God that gave theſe objects a being, and ordered their being, qualified objects for exerciſing juſtice or mercy upon, according to his pleaſure, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things according to the counſel of his will; and if ſo, here is no puniſhing of ſin by neceſſity of nature. 4. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Juſtice to be natural to God in that ſenſe that Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> aſſerts it,<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 104.</note> and ſuppoſing the objects thereof to have a being; yet ſure he doth not puniſh ſin by neceſſity of nature, as the fire burns; ſince the exerciſe of Juſtice, yea, the choice of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects upon which he will exerciſe it, are ſubjected to his free will and ſoveraignty; as is manifeſt from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18, <hi>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy; and whom he will, he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth.</hi> Rev. 4.11, <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive honour
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58137:32"/>and glory, and power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> Whereas natural neceſſity excludes freedom both in the principle of action, and the act it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Having now ſhewed what kind of neceſſity there was for the being of the Covenant of Redemption betwixt God and Chriſt; and that the neceſſity does mainly reſpect the final cauſe and ends which God had purpoſed in himſelf: Let us in the next place conſider particularly to what intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it was neceſſary that God ſhould enter into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Suretiſhip and Redemption with his own Son Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe intents and purpoſes may be reduced to two chief heads; ſuppoſing that God had purpoſed in himſelf to glorifie his mercy and Juſtice in procuring our Salvation; the Covenant of Suretiſhip and Redemption was neceſſary for both theſe ends and purpoſes: 1. For the honour of God. 2. For the ſalvation and good of his choſen people; both which were attained through the Covenant made betwixt God and Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the honour and glory of God; I mean, the <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive glory</hi> of God, that ſhines <hi>ad extra,</hi> or the manifeſtation of his glory, as the ſame is ſhewed forth and manifeſted in his dealings with the Creatures; whereof ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1, <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens declare the glory of God.</hi> Exod. 15.11, <hi>Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongſt the Gods! who is like thee, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders!</hi> Not his <hi>eſſential glory</hi> that ſhines <hi>ad intra,</hi> whereby he was infinitely and eternally glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, before any the works of Creation and Providence; and ſhould have been glorious eternally, though theſe had never been, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22.—30, <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.—Then I was by him as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoycing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, the being of this Covenant of Redemption, was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the declarative glory of God; whether we conſider God <hi>eſſentially</hi> or <hi>perſonally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For the glory of God conſidered <hi>eſſentially,</hi> or in regard of his glorious nature and eſſence, or his natural eſſential attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; I mean, his wiſdom, goodneſs, juſtice, mercy, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58137:33"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that, 1. For glorifying theſe <hi>univerſally,</hi> even all and every one of his attributes, all which received a new and glorious luſtre, through the Covenant of Redemption, and God's ſending of Chriſt to do that work which ſhould never have been known nor manifeſted on Earth, nor in Heaven, but in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, and by virtue of God's Covenant-dealings with him about our Redemption; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, <hi>For God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo Chriſt is called <hi>the brightneſs of his glory,</hi> Heb. 1.3. Chriſt Mediator is the brightneſs of the glory of God, in and through whom, his glorious attributes and nature was made conſpicuous, and the declarative glory thereof had a more glorious luſtre, than by all the works of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence beſide: upon the ſame account alſo Chriſt is called the <hi>Image of the inviſible God,</hi> Col. 1.15, becauſe the glorious excellencies of God (otherwiſe inviſible) are gloriouſly revealed by him, and to be ſeen in him. I paſs this here in a word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a more particular conſideration thereof to that part of this ſubject-matter that concerns the Mediator's perſon and office. 2. For the glorifying of theſe <hi>harmoniouſly,</hi> that the harmony of attributes in God might be manifeſted in this tranſaction; to wit, how ſweetly mercy &amp; juſtice did meet, when peace and righteouſneſs, Law-demands and Goſpel-condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Law-ſeverity and Goſpel-lenity did meet together, and were made friends by this Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10.11, <hi>Mercy and truth are met together, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other,</hi> &amp;c. For by this means God brought forth to heaven and earth, and all the Creatures, the glorious harmony of Juſtice, Truth, Mercy, Power, Wiſdom, Grace, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12, 13, <hi>Saying with a loud voice, worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power, and wiſdom, and riches, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and bleſſing. And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I, ſaying, Bleſſing, honour, glory, and power be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Covenant of Redemption was neceſſary for the glory of God conſidered <hi>perſonally;</hi> and that, 1. In regard of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58137:33"/>diſtinct ſubſiſtences and glorious perſons of the bleſſed Trinity. 2. In regard of the diſtinct offices of the three perſons, all which were gloriouſly manifeſted in God's Covenant-dealings with Chriſt. I ſay, the greateſt declarative glory and cleareſt manifeſtation of the diſtinct ſubſiſtences and Perſons of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and of the diſtinct offices of theſe Perſons in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious and bleſſed Trinity, that ever the world ſaw or heard. of, was in God's Covenant-dealings with Chriſt about the work of our Redemption; for where are there any ſuch clear diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of theſe great myſteries to be found, as in God's foederal dealings with Chriſt, and the Scriptures which reveal the ſame? God was but darkly known in the diſtinct ſubſiſtences and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Perſons of the Trinity, till this light of his Covenant with Chriſt did break forth; but in Gods ſending his Son, and the Son's undertaking and offering himſelf willingly to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to do this work; and the Holy Ghoſt's exerciſing the power of the Godhead, fitting and enabling him, the man Chriſt Jeſus, to do the work; there was a glorious manifeſtation of the diſtinction of Perſons in the Godhead, and of the offices of theſe Perſons (whereof alſo more particularly afterward). See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth; I have put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</hi> Heb. 9.14, <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal ſpirit, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God?</hi> And 10.7, <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God.</hi> Pſal. 2.7, 8, <hi>I will declare the decree, the Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> Joh. 14.26, <hi>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> Mal. 3.16, 17,—<hi>And he ſaw the ſpirit of God deſcending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo, a voice from heaven ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> and ſuch like Scriptures. Yea, ſo much was the Covenant betwixt God and Chriſt about our Redemption for the glory of God, even conſidered perſonally; that thereby (beſide the glory
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58137:34"/>that was common to all the three Perſons) there did accrue a peculiar glory to the diſtinct Perſons of the Godhead, in regard of their diſtinct offices and working in this buſineſs of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a peculiar glory to the Father, who gave Chriſt, and who ſent him upon this buſineſs, and bleſſed us in him, even a peculiar honour to the Father from the Lord Mediator and Redeemer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.49, <hi>But I honour my Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; and a peculiar honour to the Father from the ranſomed and redeemed People, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again into a lively hope by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> A peculiar honour to the Son, to Chriſt the Lord Mediator, and that both upon earth and in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, a peculiar glory to the Lamb that wrought the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto which his Father appointed him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, 23, <hi>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son: that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father;</hi> which the Son claimeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.1, 4, <hi>Theſe words ſpoke Jeſus, and lift up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid, Father the hour is come, glorifie thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glorifie thee; I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> And which is payed to him in heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.10, <hi>Saying, Salvation to our God which ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb.</hi> And 5.9, <hi>And they ſing a new ſong, ſaying, thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.</hi> A peculiar glory unto the <hi>eternal Spirit,</hi> by whom the Son of God <hi>offered himſelf without ſpot to God,</hi> Heb. 9.14; and to whom the effectual application of the purchaſed Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by peculiar office belongs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11, <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God.</hi> Joh. 6.63, <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickeneth.</hi> Gal. 4.6, <hi>And becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The good of the ranſomed and redeemed people, required that their Redemption ſhould be tranſacted in a Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Chriſt; and to this intent, and for this end it was neceſſary, 1. To introduce and uſher in the new way of

And this, I ſay, was uſhered in, and it was neceſſary that way ſhould be made for it, by God's Covenant-dealings with Chriſt, in whom his Juſtice had a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; elſe the Law-diſpenſation of Works and Nature had kept the Stage for ever, and there had been no Court wherein Grace ſits upon the throne, and wherein Sinners might plead righteouſneſs and life on Goſpel-terms. Chriſt's ſaying from eternity, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> Pſal. 40.6. <hi>And deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ranſom,</hi> Job 33.24, (Which words are upon the matter, and originally true of Chriſt's dealings with his Father,<note place="margin">Jo.

This, I ſay, uſhered in, and made way for the Goſpel-diſpenſation of a Covenant of free Grace. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſtates the riſe of life and immortality that is brought to light by the Goſpel, upon the eternal foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dealings that were betwixt God and Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10, <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our works; but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt, before the world began: But is now made manifeſt by the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> Rom. 8.3, 4, <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh; God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The Covenant of Redemption betwixt God and Chriſt was neceſſary for our good, that the Covenant of life and righteouſneſs to us in the way of this Goſpel-diſpenſation, might be pure ſoveraign Grace. Now the more of Grace and God's gracious will and heart, is in the buſineſs, and the leſs of the Creatures will and acting, the better for us, the ſweeter and the ſurer is the Covenant. But here all is of the Lord, and of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58137:35"/>his gracious will, all is tranſacted betwixt God and Chriſt, and man is not ſo much is preſent at the firſt tranſaction of the Covenant, as he was at the Covenant of works; here he is neither at the beginning, nor end of it; I mean, that end which it had in God's foederal dealings with Chriſt, where the Redemption and Salvation of the elect was a concluded buſineſs, and the concluſion tarried not, nor was ſuſpended for man's conſent; ſure this was pure Grace, this was all Grace, eminent Grace, when there was nothing of the Creature; no, not ſo much as acting in a vital formal manner, as now we act under the application of this Covenant, by theſe gracious acts which are efficiently from God; but there, all was the gracious free will of God, without any thing of the Creatures will; ſurely that was eminent ſignal Grace, and the better for us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our works; but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began.</hi> Eph. 2.10, <hi>For we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> Eph. 1.4, 5, <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame, before him in love: Having predeſtinated us unto the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children, by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A Covenant betwixt God and Chriſt about our Salvation and Redemption was neceſſary, that the buſineſs of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be far advanced, ere it come to our working at it with fear and trembling: and if our working out that which is left to be done by us, for our own Salvation, be with fear and trembling, when by this Covenant of Suretiſhip we are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the poſſible reach of actual periſhing; O what ſhould our working for Salvation have been without this Covenant of Suretiſhip, but endleſs, fruitleſs toiling, with deſparation! but by the Covenant of Redemption, our Salvation is far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, before our little finger be at the work; nay, it is in ſome reſpect finiſhed, all the hard labour is over, Juſtice is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the ſtrength of oppoſition is broken, and we have only broken forces, and a beaten adverſary to deal with; we have little more to do but to ſtand and ſee him work Salvation for us, and apply his purchaſed Redemption; and yet we have work

               <p n="4">4. A Covenant betwixt God and Chriſt about our Salvation, was neceſſary, that the ſpring and fountain of the life of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, might lie out of our ſelves; by the Covenant of works, the ſpring of life and bleſſedneſs to man, lay in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; all his treaſure and ſtore was in his ſtock of habitual Grace; but now by this Covenant of Suretiſhip, the water-cock is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed within our own hearts: I mean, Faith, by which we draw life and vertue out of Chriſt, and through which he conveys it unto us; but the fountain and well-head lyes on high: for by the Covenant of Redemption, God was carrying on a deſign of love to his elect people; and this was part of the contrivance, that our Covenant-ſtate through Chriſt's Suretiſhip might be Fountain-Love and Grace; a ſtate of favour ſetled and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed in the fountain of life and grace, Chriſt: Whereas <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Covenant-ſtate was but Ciſtern-Grace, that did not run continually with a ſpring of live waters, to afford freſh ſupplies; the ſtock of habitual Grace was to him like water in the Pitcher or Ciſtern; but by Chriſt's Covenant of Suretiſhip, Grace is to us, as water in the Fountain, that can never run dry: <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16, <hi>And of his fulneſs have all we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and grace for grace.</hi> And 4.14,—<hi>But the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> And 14.19,—<hi>becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> 2 Cor. 9.8, <hi>And God is able to make all grace abound towards you, that ye always having alſufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This Covenant of Suretiſhip was neceſſary for our eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment under this new diſpenſation, that our Rights might be in a ſurer hand than our own: Man is a mutable thing, and free-will is a tottering uncertain thing, as experience hath taught; but <hi>Chriſt is a ſure foundation;</hi> and holding of him, or rather in him, is a ſure renure; the Rights and Charters that are under his cuſtody, are well kept: And therefore God who inſtituted this diſpenſation, did for the better ſecuring of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58137:36"/>believers intereſts, enter into Covenant with a mighty reſponſal perſon, even Chriſt; and conſolidates our Covenant-right in Chriſt our head, and did truſt to his keeping and anſwering all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the great Charter of the Goſpel-covenant; hence it is that the Covenant of peace made with us, is a ſure Covenant, becauſe 'tis thus ordered; Chriſt acted that buſineſs in the Covenant of Redemption; there were mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual aſſurances given between the Father and the Son, which makes all Covenant-dealing with us ſure, and holds all faſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.34, 35, <hi>My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.

               <p n="6">6. This Covenant with Chriſt, was neceſſary; not only for the enfuring our bleſſedneſs by this new Goſpel-diſpenſation; but for the bettering of that bleſſedneſs and glorious ſtate unto which we are advanced by this Covenant. I ſay, the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the glory, the heaven of the redeemed people, of the

                  <hi>many Sons,</hi> who are by the force of this Covenant <hi>brought to glory,</hi> Heb. 2.10, is better than the reward and crown of bleſſedneſs which man ſhould have enjoyed by the tenor of the Covenant of works; and this bettering, it hath from Chriſt's Covenant of Suretiſhip with God, which was the chief cauſe why this Goſpel-diſpenſation is a <hi>better Covenant</hi> than that of the Law of works; and the promiſes thereof are <hi>better promiſes,</hi> and the crown and heaven thereof a better crown; even becauſe Chriſt is in this Covenant, and the foundation of it was laid in his Suretiſhip, by this means the bleſſedneſs and heaven of this Covenant is bettered: For, 1. It is the glory of new heavens, created of purpoſe for the reſidence of the redeemed, in the company of him that redeemed them by his own blood, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13, <hi>Nevertheleſs, we according to his promiſe, look for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs.</hi> Rev. 21.1, 5, <hi>And I ſaw a new heaven and a new earth, for the firſt heaven and the firſt earth were paſſed away, and there was no more ſea.

                  </note> Whereas the bleſſedneſs and glory of man by the Law-Covenant (if it was any thing beyond an immortality of bleſſedneſs and enjoyment of God in an earthly Paradiſe; which is queſtioned by ſome) ſhould yet have been in this old or firſt heavens, not in theſe new ones. 2. It is the glory of a Paradiſe wherein is the tree of life, and the river of the water of life, which were not Ingredients of the Law-glory; neither were placed in the firſt Paradiſe. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7, <hi>To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> And 7.17,—<hi>and ſhall lead them unto living fountains of waters.</hi> And 22.1, 2, <hi>And he ſhewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as criſtal, proceeding out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb. In the midſt of the ſtreet of it, and of either ſide of the river was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations.</hi> 3. It is a heaven and glory where the new Song is ſung, and where the Muſitians are all redeemed, and where the meeting of theſe redeemed ones to ſing together, is the ſweeter, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58137:37"/>they once were all loſt, and that they came out of tribulation and a Land of ſighing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.10, <hi>And the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return and come to Zion with ſongs and everlaſting joy upon their heads; they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſs, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away.</hi> Rev. 5.9, <hi>And they ſung a new ſong, ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.</hi> But there ſhould not have been any new Song, nor redeemed Muſicians in the glory and heaven of Law-diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 4. It is a heaven and glory wherein all the Inhabitants wear crowns; for Chriſt hath <hi>made them kings unto God, and to his Father,</hi> Rev. 1.6. And 2.10,—<hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life;</hi> but there ſhould have been no crowns worn in the firſt Paradiſe; nor ſhould the happineſs thereof have amounted ſo high as a crown and a throne; there being no occaſion for it, nor any promiſe to that effects. 5. It is a heaven and glory, where the Inhabitants are all conquerors, each hath a palm in his hand, in ſign of his victory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9,—<hi>cloathed with white robes, and palms in their hands;</hi> this Garland ſhould not have been in the firſt Covenant-glory; where there was no fighting, there could be no victory, at leaſt over the world, and ſin and death. 6. It is a heaven and glory, where all the Inhabitants are cloathed with long white robes, and with fine linnen clean and white, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.13,—<hi>What are theſe which are arrayed in white robes, and whence came they?</hi> And 19.8, <hi>And to her was granted, that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine linnen, clean and white: for the linnen is the righteouſneſs of Saints;</hi> but there ſhould have been no ſuch robes in the Law-heaven: whatſoever ſhining-beauty and whiteneſs ſhould have been on <hi>Adam</hi>'s skin; yet there ſhould have been there no garments of glory, no righteouſneſs ſhould have been worn there, but that which ſhould have been of our own working. 7. It is a heaven wherein there is a throne for the Lamb, where the man Chriſt in our nature is upon the throne, where the greateſt beauty of all the Kingdom, and the moſt highly exalted perſon, is the man Chriſt; where the Lord Mediator is the glorious light of all the Land, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7,—<hi>he that openeth and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no man openeth.</hi> And 21.22, 23, <hi>And I ſaw no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therein; for the Lord God almighty and the lamb, are the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58137:37"/>temple of it. And the City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamb is the light thereof.</hi> And 5.12, <hi>Worthy is the lamb that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and glory, and honour, and bleſſing;</hi> there was no ſuch glory in the firſt Covenant, nor in the heaven thereof; which no doubt ſhould have made it leſs glorious, and ſpeaks forth the greater glory of this latter Covenant-happineſs. 8. It is a heaven that was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at a dear rate, that was the price of blood; for which Chriſt payed a condign price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19, <hi>For as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed will corruptible things; but with the precious blood of Chriſt as of a lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot;</hi> but the Law-heaven and glory, ſhould have been obtained at an eaſier rate; working, without the price of blood, ſhould have done that buſineſs; the different price ſhews the different value. 9. It is a heaven wherein is a lovely and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous aſſembly, a fair myſtical body, whereof Chriſt is the head, and whereof each redeemed Soul is a member. O ſo lovely a Company with the Captain of their Salvation! ſo glorious a body with their glorious head! ſo beautiful a bride with ſo fair a husband! ſuch a lovely couple, ſuch a body corporate, ſuch a compleat ſociety, when Chriſt myſtical is perfected, and all the members compacted together, and joyned unto their glorious and bleſſed head! <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13, <hi>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledg of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> And 5.27, <hi>That he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> Heb. 12.23, <hi>To the general aſſembly and church of the firſt born, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judg of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect; and to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant.</hi> Rev. 19.7, <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her ſelf ready.</hi> But there ſhould have been no ſuch body-corporate in the Law-heaven, no ſuch myſtical body of Chriſt, no marriage of the Lamb, nor any melodious rejoycing at that ſolemnity. I conclude therefore, that the glory, and crown, and heaven of the Covenant of Redemption, is better, and far more glorious, than ſhould have been the lot of man, by Law-righteouſneſs and works, without Chriſt's Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip.</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:58137:38"/>7. This Covenant was neceſſary, for having in readineſs a Phyſitian, before we ſhould be ſick; God foreſaw and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed man's fall, and his riſing again; and he well knew that it would be a wretched hopeleſs condition, for man to provide a Phyſitian to himſelf, and to have him to ſeek when his ſickneſs ſhould be deſparate; he therefore by a foreſight and providence of pure, ſoveraign, free, tranſcendent Grace, did provide one; and indeed it was neceſſary for our good, that it ſhould be ſo; for had man fallen ſick of ſin, before this Covenant for ſending a healer to him, he had died ere the cure could come.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This Covenant was neceſſary for cutting off all matter and occaſion of ſelf-gloriation from man in his own Redemption and Salvation; for if the buſineſs of our Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was tranſacted, concluded, done and ended betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, without our knowledg or conſent, before we had a Being; what have we to boaſt of?

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Nature, Properties, and Parties of the Covenant of Redemption.</head>
               <p>THE general Nature of this Covenant is common to it, with all other Covenants; whatſoever different peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity they have, this is eſſential and common to all Covenants; they are <hi>Agreements:</hi> and this is an eternal tranſaction and agreement betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and the Mediator Chriſt, about the work of our Redemption.</p>
               <p>The peculiar propriety of its nature, will appear by enquiring a little into, 1. The various eternal acts of the will of God that concurred to make up this agreement. 2. The diſtinction and order of theſe eternal acts of his will, and the right manner of our conceiving of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppoſing, as we have ſaid before, that God purpoſed in himſelf not to ſave man without a ſatisfaction to his Juſtice: Theſe eternal acts of the will of God, or rather the things which we conceive under theſe various acts, and their denominations among men (for we need to multiply acts in this matter, but for the helping our own underſtanding) did concur and meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this agreement. 1. The deſignation of a Perſon to do this work; there muſt needs have been a Perſon ſet apart and deſigned from eternity unto the doing of the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this Perſon was the Son only; not the Father, not the Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, <hi>Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world; but was manifeſted in theſe laſt times for you.</hi> 2. The preparation and fitting of the Perſon ſet apart to take our Law-place, and room, that Juſtice might ſmite him in our ſtead; which alſo was by an eternal act of the will of God decreed, that the Son of God ſhould be <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with us, or <hi>God made manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> Iſa. 7.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, and unto this incarnation of the Son of God, his own words have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as unto the grand qualification whereby he was deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated before-hand, that he might be in a capacity to do this work, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, <hi>A body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> 3. The calling
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58137:39"/>of the Perſon deſigned: calling is an act different from deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'tis ſomething further. Chriſt was by an eternal act of God's will called to this work, and that long before he came into the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19, <hi>Then thou ſpakeſt in viſion to thy holy. One, and ſaidſt, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one choſen out of the people.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, <hi>I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſs, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a Covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.</hi> Heb. 5.5, <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be made an high prieſt; but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</hi> 4. The inveſting of the Perſon deſigned, with offices, powers and authorities, for the doing of this work, ſuch as his Mediatory-office, and the powers and authorities thereunto belonging, which was not ſuſpended until the time of his actual diſcharge of the offices of King, Prieſt, and Prophet; but by an eternal act of the will of God, he was ſet up and veſted with theſe offices and powers from everlaſting, and had the glory of the deſigned, called, inveſted Mediator; as he plainly inſinuates, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23, <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſaith Wiſdom; ſeveral Expoſitors render it, <hi>I was called,</hi> or <hi>I was annointed.</hi> Joh. 17.5, <hi>And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was.</hi> 5. The miſſion of the Son, Chriſt deſigned, ſitted, called, inveſted for this work, was alſo by an eternal act in the counſel of God, ſent to do this work; he had a ſolema eternal, authoritative miſſion, a command to go, and was bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den go; he had the will of God by an eternal act or commiſſion given out to him concerning all this work, long before he was actually made under the Law; to which he hath reſpect, when he ſaith, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> Heb. 10.7. even that will of God that was in the book of his eternal decrees, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39, <hi>And this is the Fathers will which hath ſent me.</hi> And 10.18, <hi>This Commandment have I received of my Father:</hi> But in all theſe, we do not ſo much multiply the diſtinction of acts, as we take notice of the diſtinction and difference of Phraſe uſed by the Holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking of this myſterie in the Scriptures. Upon the other part, there concurred unto this agreement, an eternal perſonal conſent and compliance upon Chriſt's part, unto all theſe eternal acts of the will of God; for <hi>Chriſt God,</hi> equal with the Father, does not begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58137:39"/>and agree unto any thing in time; nor can the eternal Son of God will any thing in time, which he did not will and conſent unto from eternity. But Chriſt was preſent with the Father, and did from eternity conſent and agree to theſe eternal acts. 1. To the deſignation of himſelf to be the perſon that ſhould ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, he heartily acquieſced and offered himſelf; he ſaid, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will,</hi> Heb. 10.5, 7. <hi>He poured out his Soul unto death,</hi> Iſa. 53.12. 2. He conſented unto the putting himſelf in that low capacity that the working of this work required, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7, <hi>Thou madeſt him a little lower than the Angels;</hi> to leave the throne of glory, and come down to his footſtool, there to be in diſgrace; the Lord of the Law, to be <hi>made under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4.4. the holy one that knew no ſin, to be made <hi>in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3. Phil. 2.6, 7, 8, <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> 3. He conſented and agreed unto the eternal act of his calling to this work; no ſooner was it his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will that he ſhould travel in the buſineſs, but it was his alſo. He was as a ready Servant, whoſe ear was bored in token of his love and willingneſs to ſerve his Maſter, when he might have been free, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, <hi>Mine ears haſt thou opened</hi> or <hi>bored,</hi> Iſa. 50.5, 6, <hi>The Lord hath opened mine ears, and I was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, neither turned away back.</hi> 4. He conſented to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on theſe offices and truſts that the work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required; there was no force nor conſtraint upon, no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nature that he ſhould ſtep in betwixt the diſagreeing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he ſhould ſtep into the fire that we had kindled, that he ſhould make himſelf a Sacrifice for our ſins, that he ſhould receive a diſpenſatory Kingdom; but frankly and freely he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to do all theſe things, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18, <hi>No man taketh my life from me; but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi> Joh. 17.2, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> Prov. 8.23, <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</hi> 5. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto his miſſion, his Father's ſending of him, and was well content to go that errand; yea, ſo hearty was his conſent, that he took delight in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8, <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy Law is within my heart.</hi> Joh. 4.34, <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58137:40"/>ſaith unto them, my meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi> And to all theſe things he gives a perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from eternity, and with ſo much delight, that he ſolaced himſelf, and took pleaſure in the future accompliſhment of theſe eternal acts of the will of God concerning the Sons of men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23, 30, 31, <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. Then I was by him as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoycing always before him: Rejoycing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the Sons of men.</hi> This is the nature of this eternal tranſaction, which will appear alſo more clearly afterward from the tenor of this Covenant, with the reciprocal engagements of the parties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the diſtinction and order of theſe eternal acts of the will of God, and for preventing groſs and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming thoughts of them; I give theſe cautions. 1. All the acts of God's will, his decrees, and eternal tranſaction with Chriſt, are in regard of God, one moſt ſimple and pure act of his will; but in regard of our conceptions of them, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take up many particular acts together in one; they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed and expreſſed ſo in the word, that we may take them up diſtinctly: The Lord in his way of expreſſing theſe great myſteries of the counſel of his will, accommodating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to our way of conceiving things: we are therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to take heed how we conceive of the diſtinction of acts in the eternal counſel of God's will. 2. When we ſpeak of the order of theſe eternal acts, we mean only the order of <hi>Nature,</hi> and which of theſe acts are to be conceived by us antecedaneous to the reſt in that reſpect; for there is no order of <hi>time,</hi> no priority nor poſteriority of that kind among the decrees of God, and acts of his will, which are all eternal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are to conceive of this order (which only agreeth to the decrees of God) according to theſe rules:</p>
               <p n="1">1. According to the futurition of things; that is, theſe decrees and eternal acts of the will of God about things <hi>ad extra</hi> without, which do ſuppoſe the futurition of things about which theſe decrees are paſt; theſe decrees (I ſay) do neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome other acts of the will of God antecedent to theſe in order of nature, whence the things ſuppoſed in that decree, had their futurition; for 'tis to me above queſtion, that things
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58137:40"/>which did not exiſt from eternity, had their futurition no where, but from the decrees of God's will, which made them future things before they exiſted; neither is it poſſible that God could foreſee any thing as future, before his decree, and ſome act of his will gave it futurition; whatſoever the device of <hi>Scientiae media,</hi> tell us to the contrary. And according to this rule, we ſay, the decree of God's entering in Covenant with man, whether by Law or Grace, does ſuppoſe ſome antecedaneous act of the will of God (in order of nature) concerning the Creation of man, ſome decree whence man had a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition, and exiſted in the preſcience of God as a future thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may conceive of the order of the decrees of God, according as he orders things in execution, by that rule ſo much made uſe of by the Learned Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Twiſſ.</hi> Vind. gratiae &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Divin.</note> 
                  <hi>Quod prius eſt in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione poſterius eſt in executione &amp; contra:</hi> that which is firſt in the intention of God, is laſt in the execution; and that which is laſt in the intent, is firſt in the execution. Underſtand this rule, as that Author doth, without ſubordination of the co-ordinate means whereby God intended to make himſelf glorious in the way of mercy and juſtice; and according to this rule, we ſay that God firſt decreed the glorifying of his mercy and juſtice upon all mankind, before he decreed any thing concerning his creation, or his fall: for the creation and fall of man, were firſt in execution, before juſtice and mercy was glorified in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another rule (which alſo is a qualification of the former) is, that theſe eternal acts of the will of God which <hi>reſpiciunt finem,</hi> relate to the end, are in this kind of order before; theſe acts of his will which <hi>reſpiciunt media</hi> relate unto the means which lead unto theſe ends, <hi>Et illud quod habet rationem finis eſt prius, quod vero habet rationem medii eſt poſterius;</hi> And that which hath the place of the end, is the firſt; and that which hath the place of the mean, is laſt in order among the eternal acts or God's will. And this rule holds not only with reſpect to the ſupream and chief end; to wit, God's glorifying of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the way of manifeſting his mercy and juſtice, which is firſt in order among the eternal acts of the will of God rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to man; and all the other acts of his will, concerning the creation, fall, ſending of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which are co ordinate
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58137:41"/>means in reſpect of this ſupream end, to which they are ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate): Theſe, I ſay, are poſterior in this kind of order, among the decrees of God, and eternal acts of his will; but this rule holds alſo in reſpect of that ſubordination that may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among theſe acts of the will of God, about the creation and fall of man, and the ſending of Chriſt (which are co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate means in reſpect of the ſupream end before-mentioned); yet becauſe one of theſe may have the place of an end, with reſpect to another of theſe ſame co-ordinate means, which may be alſo a means for carrying on ſome next immediate end, as well as the ſupream ultimate end; as the Salvation of the elect is a mean ſubſervient to the great end of glorifying Grace, and yet may be, and is alſo, an end of God's ſending Chriſt; ſo that the ſending of Chriſt, is both a mean ſubordinate to the glory of Grace, and the Salvation of God's elect people. Now, I ſay, which way ſoever we look upon the acts of God's will about the glorifying of his juſtice and mercy on Mankind, we are ſtill to conceive of the eternal acts of his will, that reſpect the ends which he has propoſed to himſelf, both ſupream and ſubordinate, as firſt in order; and theſe acts of his will that relate to the means, as laſt: for God firſt purpoſed the end, then the means that lead to it.</p>
               <p>By this time it may appear that there is no great cauſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the order and diſtinction of theſe eternal acts of the will of God, that concurred to the making up this eternal tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and the Mediator, ſince they are all co-ordinate acts of the counſel of his will, and means for the carrying on the glory of his mercy and juſtice in ſaving man. This much is manifeſt, 1. That the Covenant of Redemption made with Chriſt, doth ſuppoſe other eternal acts of the will of God, about the ſaving of man in the way of ſatisfaction to juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof I have ſpoken before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 2. That the deſignation, calling, and eternal miſſion of the Son of God to do this work, muſt in order be before the perſon deſigned and called, gave his actual conſent, and cloſed the bargain from eternity. And if any will contend about the order of theſe eternal acts before-mentioned, I do not ſee why we may not fitly conceive of them in this order, <hi>deſigning, calling, fitting, inveſting, ſending</hi> of Chriſt; theſe were the eternal acts of the will of God, which were entertained by the Son of God <hi>with conſent</hi> and <hi>delectation.</hi>

               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:58137:41"/>
               <p>The Properties of the Covenant of Redemption, are,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Mr.</hi> Rutherf. Treat. of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinant. <hi>p. 2. c. 12.</hi>
                  </note> Freedom, Graciouſneſs, Eternity, Equality, Order, and Stability.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Covenant that was tranſacted betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, was a moſt <hi>free</hi> Covenant: it was an act of meer liberty and ſoveraign freedom. There was eminent freedom upon both ſides, in both the parties Covenanting. 1. Upon the Father's ſide (abſtracting from his own decrees and purpoſes), it was free to <hi>Jehovah</hi> to have followed a ſtrict Law-courſe according to the rigour of the Covenant of works; or to follow a Goſpel-way of mitigation and condeſcenſion as pleaſed him; it was free to him to ſend, or not to ſend a Saviour to ſuffer for man; to take a ſatisfaction by a Surety, or only in the Soul that ſinned, as pleaſed him. 2. Upon Chriſt's part, it was as free to him to be a ſuffering Redeemer and Surety, or not, as pleaſed him; to undertake the work of our Redemption, or not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it; to humble himſelf unto this ſervice, or not; to go this errand, or not, as pleaſed him. Hence 'tis obſerved,<note place="margin">Jo. Cocc. <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Doct. de ſoed.</hi> c. 5. Sect. 90.</note> that it was otherwiſe with the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> than with the firſt; for it was not free to <hi>Adam</hi> to withdraw from, or to deny ſubjection to the firſt Covenant; neither could he withdraw himſelf from the Law of Nature, nor ſlight the promiſe thereof, without the violation of that Law: but the Son of God was free, and tyed by no Law antecedent to his own conſent.</p>
               <p>This Property of the Covenant of Redemption, is eſtabliſhed and confirmed, 1. From theſe Scriptures which attribute this tranſaction to the free pleaſure and ſoveraign freedom of both parties, the Father and Chriſt; therefore the Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's eternal tranſactions with Chriſt about our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, doth ſo frequently call them, deeds and acts of will, and of the Father's pleaſure; and that the whole procedure was <hi>according to his good pleaſure, and the pleaſure of his will,</hi> Eph. 1.5.9. And <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19, <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> 2 Tim. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>according to his purpoſe and grace,</hi> &amp;c. And upon the other part, Chriſt's conceſſions in this matter, are attributed to his meer will and liberty, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, <hi>Who being in the form of God,</hi> having the very ſame divine eſſence which the father hath, <hi>thought it not robbery to be equal with God;</hi> counted it no uſurpation to carry himſelf as God, equal with the Father; <hi>made himſelf of no reputation,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:58137:42"/>freely, and of his own accord, <hi>he hionbled himſelf;</hi> not uſing nor manifeſting the glory that was competent to him, <hi>and took upon him the form of a ſervant;</hi> he took upon him a real ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the aſſumption of the humane nature, for the ends he aſſumed it, <hi>and was made in the likeneſs of men;</hi> and in this ſervice he did behave himſelf, as other men, and ſutably to that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and not as equal with God, which was his natural condition; and while he was in that habit and condition, he <hi>obeyed unto the death of the Croſs.</hi> All this he acted with emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent freedom in time; and conſented to with like freedom from eternity, where he freely took upon him whatſoever he acted within time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it was free with God, whether he would give to man a Being, and whether he would conclude this in the counſel of his will from eternity, or not, as pleaſed him; ſure it was alſo free to God whether he would ſend a Saviour to him when he ſhould be loſt, or not, as pleaſed him: Now 'tis manifeſt that it was free with God, whether he would ſo much as give to man a being; for he was under no neceſſity to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the World, or Men, or Angels, all which are for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and therefore are whatſoever they are, by his pleaſure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11, <hi>Thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If it was free to God from eternity, whether he would chuſe objects in Mankind, to magnifie his Grace and Mercy upon, when he had purpoſed to create Angels and men; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would let them all periſh, and not take any of their natures upon him; then the Covenant of Suretiſhip hath this property of freedom; but it is manifeſt that it was free with God from eternity, whether he would recover any of the race of fallen man, or not, as pleaſed him; ſince he was no more tyed to Men than to Angels, to whom he ſent no Saviour when they fell, nor hath deſigned any of the fallen Angels unto Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, <hi>For if God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be reſerved unto the day of Judgment.</hi> Heb. 2.16, <hi>For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels; but he took upon him the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> It remains therefore, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption is an act of ſoveraignty and freedom upon God's part who deſigned a Redeemer, and upon Chriſt's part who conſented unto the deſignation.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:58137:42"/>4. This Property of the Covenant of Redemption is further confirmed, by the negation and removal of all things contrary to ſoveraign freedom. 1. There was nothing from himſelf (abſtracting from his own decrees, and love-deſigns) that could trench upon the freedom of this eternal act of his will; for there was no neceſſity of nature upon <hi>Jehovah,</hi> nor upon the Son of God, that did determine God to enter in this Covenant (as is already cleared). 2. There was nothing from without that could trench upon the freedom of this eternal act; as nothing could neceſſarily determine, ſo neither compel nor conſtrain God to lay ſuch a ſervice upon his own Son Chriſt, nor him to undertake it; For 1. This tranſaction having been from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was a concluded bargain before the creatures had a being, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23, <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</hi> 2. Put caſe they had then had a being; what could the being of Men and Angels, and all the works of his hands have trenched upon the ſoveraign freedom of their Makers will and actings? <hi>for who hath reſiſted his will?—hath not the potter power over the clay?</hi> Rom. 9.19, 21. 3. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son were not only free from all natural neceſſity and outward compulſion; but alſo from all hire, allurement or motive from any thing without their own will; there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in man, no not foreſeen, that could allure or move; far leſs hire the Father to give Chriſt, to engage him in this work, nor Chriſt to engage his name in our bond; ſince he well foreſaw what it would coſt him; It's true he values his ſeed as a ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing return of his travel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied;</hi> but beſide that, there is no proportion betwixt his work, and this poor wages: was man a price for the Lord of glory to work for? or was he a reward for him to wreſtle for? could he be hired for ſo low a wager, if the ſoveraign freedom of his own will had not acted him? Conſider, I ſay, who gave this price to the Lord: did man give himſelf to the Lord, or did the Lord give his elect people to Chriſt from eternity, and afterward he is the firſt giver alſo? Now there can be no hire given by man to the Lord, unleſs he were the firſt giver, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35, <hi>For who hath firſt given to him, and it ſhall be recompenced to him again?</hi> 1 Chr. 29.14, <hi>Of thine own have we given thee.</hi> Jer. 30.21, <hi>And I will cauſe him to draw neer, and he ſhall approach unto me; for who is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58137:43"/>he that engageth his heart to approach unto me, ſaith the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Property of this Covenant is <hi>Graciouſneſs;</hi> it is not only the Covenant tranſacted with us, the Goſpel-Covenant, that is, pure Grace; but this alſo that was tranſacted betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, even while it was yet in his purpoſe, and as it was the eternal act of his will, is frequently called <gap reason="foreign">

Graciouſneſs is attributed to the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in regard of both Parties tranſacting; it was pure Grace that determined both the Parties, and engaged them both; the Father to ſend, and the Son to come; and this Grace was equally in both the Parties, and did ſhine equally and by way of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in them both, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13, <hi>The counſel of peace was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them both.</hi> But graciouſneſs is attributed to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of reconciliation; becauſe of the ſhining glory and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Grace of God through Jeſus Chriſt, that is therein manifeſted; which Grace is in us ſubjectively; and though the acts thereof be ours in a vital formal manner; yet it is from God by way of efficiency, and it is his Grace, not ours, from which the Covenant hath its name of Grace, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6, 7. And 2.5, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. 2. Graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is attributed to the Covenant of Reconciliation; not only in regard of God's making ſuch a Covenant with us; but alſo in regard of the tenor of that Covenant, and whole diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the promiſes, conditions and reward therein is all pure Grace; as the ſame is oppoſed unto, and contra-diſtinguiſhed from works, which ſignifie nothing in that Covenant, as it is a Court of Righteouſneſs and Life, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9, <hi>For by grace are ye ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God. Not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> But of this Covenant of Redemption, Graciouſneſs is a property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; mainly, becauſe of the reaſons following; but not becauſe the whole tenor thereof, as well the conditions as promiſes were pure Grace conſidered as ſuch, and contra-diſtinguiſhed from works: For though pure Grace made this Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet the condition thereof upon both ſides were works.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58137:43"/>1. Chriſt is a doer and fulfiller of the Covenant of works moſt exactly in all points, both the command, and the curſe and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Covenant, is ſatisfied by him; this is works, and this was the condition required upon his part, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, <hi>Then ſaid I, lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God.</hi> Gal. 3.13, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt as a doer and obedient fulfiller of the Law, hath a reward in Juſtice by the promiſe of this Covenant: For (I humbly conceive) he had his reward of debt, and merit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving payed a condign price to the Juſtice of God; therefore his reward is due to him, by commutative Juſtice, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8, <hi>But made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of man; And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs; wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him,</hi> and is craved by him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, 5, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do. And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Graciouſneſs is attributed to the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1. <hi>Efficiently,</hi> or in regard of the efficient cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; the ſpring whence it came was Grace, pure Grace, and nothing elſe made it and gave it a being; it was not only an act of will, pleaſure, freedom and ſoveraignty; but an act of gracious will, and <hi>the good pleaſure of his will,</hi> that made it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Graciouſneſs is attributed to this Covenant <hi>ultimately,</hi> in regard that the ultimate end and ſcope thereof is the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting the glory of the richneſs and freeneſs of Grace; tis a deſign of Grace that is driven and carried on in the Covenant of Redemption, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6, <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9, <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling; not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Graciouſneſs is attributed to the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe Grace was in it <hi>fundamentally;</hi> the whole contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and diſpenſation of Grace is bottomed upon this eternal
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58137:44"/>tranſaction, and turns upon the hinge of this Compact betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt; therefore all the mercies and faithfulneſs of the Lord that we are made to ſing of within time, are laid upon this foundation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.1, 2, 3, <hi>I will ſing of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Lord for ever, with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulneſs to all generations. For I have ſaid, mercy ſhall be built up for ever, thy faithfulneſs ſhalt thou eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh in the very heavens. I have made a Covenant with my choſen.</hi>

Graciouſneſs may be attributed to the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, becauſe Grace was here <hi>originally;</hi> for here the firſt draughts of pure, ſoveraign, free Grace, and the unſearchable riches thereof, were drawn and portrayed; here is fountain-Grace, and from thence came the ſtreams; here were the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of that noble deſign of Grace laid, and from hence did they come forth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26, 27, <hi>Even the myſterie which had been hid from ages and from generations; but now is made manifeſt to his Saints.

               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="6">6. Graciouſneſs is attributed to this Covenant, becauſe Grace is here <hi>eminently;</hi> and indeed if the compariſon might be fitly made, pure Goſpel free Grace is more in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, than in the Covenant of Reconciliation; for 'tis in the Covenant of Redemption principally, as water is in the fountain; and in the Covenant of Reconciliation by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequentially; becauſe <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world to himſelf</hi> by that Covenant; therefore he is now

               <p n="7">7. Graciouſneſs is attributed to the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe Grace was therein <hi>exemplarily;</hi> for hereby God did act Grace in Chriſt, and made him a Samplar, and the firſt copy of free Grace to all his brethren, ſeed and heirs, that they might ſhare with him, upon whom the firſt acts of eternal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-love, and Grace fell, and that God might ſhew forth in him a pattern of Covenant-dealings, and out letting of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-favour and promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.26, <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my ſalvation.</hi> With <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5, <hi>For unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Property of the Covenant of Redemption, is <hi>Eternity:</hi> For, 1. Both the <hi>Parties</hi> are eternal, <hi>the eternal God</hi> who is <hi>from everlaſting to everlaſting,</hi> Deut. 33.27. and the eternal Son of God, whoſe eternal <hi>power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1.20, is <hi>equal with God</hi> his Father. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, <hi>And who ſhall declare his generation?</hi> Iſa. 53.8.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>union</hi> of the two natures in the Perſon of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, which was tranſacted in this Covenant, is an eternal union; I mean, the humane nature, which was from eternity
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58137:45"/>deſigned unto a ſubſtantial union with God; being once aſſumed, ſtands in that ſubſtantial union for ever; ſo that it is impoſſible that the perſonal union which was tranſacted in the Covenant of Redemption, can be diſſolved unto all eternity: for 'tis unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable that Chriſt ſhall ſtand glorified in our nature in heaven for ever; for even there is a throne for the man Chriſt, for the Lamb ſlain, for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3, <hi>But the throne of God, and of the lamb, ſhall be in it,</hi> Act. 17.31.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The New <hi>Covenant-relations</hi> which were eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, by this Covenant of Redemption, are eternal relations, which ſhall never ceaſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5, <hi>For unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?

               <p n="4">4. The <hi>offices</hi> which Chriſt did take on by this Covenant, are eternal offices, ſuch as ſhall never ceaſe, and whereof he ſhall never be diveſted; that his Mediatory-office, his Kingdom and Prieſthood, are partakers of the eternity of this Covenant, is plain Scripture, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.33, <hi>And he ſhall reign over the houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there ſhall be no end.</hi> Heb. 1.8, <hi>But unto the Son, he ſaith, thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever, a ſcepter of righteouſneſs is the ſcepter of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>

               <p>Concerning the full anſwer whereof,<note place="margin">Rutherf. <hi>Treat. of the Covenant,</hi> p. 2. c. 12. p. 363.</note> I refer the Reader to what is written by Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> upon that queſtion: For my part it ſatisfies me, that I ſee veſtiges in the Scripture. 1. That after the laſt Judgment, there ſhall be no uſe of ſuch exerciſe and acts of Chriſt's Mediatory offices, as King, Prieſt, and Prophet to his Church as we are now under in this laſt Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy and diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace; becauſe there ſhall be no ſin then, nor any enemy unſubdued; Chriſt having perfected his people, and preſented them without ſpot to God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27. and having ſubdued all his foes, and broken all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his Kingdom, and the elect people being brought out of danger, ſo as they need no Temple or Ordinances, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. 2. That Chriſt Mediator ſhall unqueſtionably ceaſe from, and leave off ſuch acts and exerciſe of his Mediatory-office, as his body the Church hath no need of; he ſhall be no Mediator of Reconciliation then, becauſe there ſhall be no ſin then; no Mediator to apply his death, or to interceed for ſinners, for there ſhall be no ſinners; he ſhall be no Mediatory King then to beat down his foes and oppoſers of his offices; for there ſhall be none, <hi>when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority and power,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.24. that is, all Magiſtracy and Government that now is, either in Church or State. 3. It is manifeſt that after the laſt Judgment, there ſhall be a change of the Oeconomick government, and that Chriſt ſhall <hi>render the kingdom</hi> Oeconomick or diſpenſatory, <hi>to his father:</hi> but after what manner this change of government ſhall be, I do not ſo clearly underſtand: whether it ſhall be only by Chriſt's rendering an account to his Father of his deputed and delegated charge, having now ſaved all the elect, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all the rebels; or if it ſhall be by laying down his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, no more to rule in the former way of government; or whether the government ſhall be ſo changed, as the Father, Son, and Spirit, ſhall immediately govern the glorious Church, which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58137:46"/>ſeems to be inſinuated, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22, 23, <hi>And I ſaw no temple therein; for the Lord God almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.28, <hi>that God may be all in all.</hi> 4. That Chriſt ſhall not then leave off to reign as Mediator, even when the fore-mentioned change is made; yet he remains the ſubſtantial glorified head of his myſtical glorified body for ever, who ſhall appear eternally for us, as a pledg of the ſatisfaction once given, whoſe preſence is a ſpeaking token of the ſtanding Confederacy and Peace betwixt God and us, in whoſe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs we ſtand cloathed before God; in whoſe tranſactions and acting in the work of Redemption, God is eternally well-pleaſed, and by whoſe Covenant we ſtand and reign with him eternally and indefectibly in a confirmed glorified ſtate: elſe, 1. To what end ſhall Chriſt ſtand glorified in our nature in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ever? 2. Why is the Lambs throne in heaven eternal? <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3. 3. Elſe what means the Lambs ſervants in heaven for ever? <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3. and the new Song that is to the Lamb in heaven for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12. and 7.10. 4. Elſe what meaneth the Lambs being in the midſt of the glorified company, his leading them, being a temple, and a light unto them? <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.17. and 21.22, 23. Sure the Lord Mediator as a glorified head of his glorious body in heaven, acteth as Mediator, though not as he acteth now; and though we cannot well determine what fort of leading, and what diſpenſation of influences from him are there (and no wonder if his union with us and headſhip over us even here, be a myſterie, the knowledg whereof is referred to his coming again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.20, <hi>At that day ye ſhall know that I am in my father, and you in me, and I in you</hi>): yet the Lambs throne there, and his leading the redeemed, and being a light and temple to them, proves his peculiar headſhip to them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, it is a Covenant which was tranſacted
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58137:46"/>from eternity, before the foundation of the world was laid; it is as old as the Ancient of days; ſo that we cannot reckon the beginning thereof, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23, <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was:</hi> and which ſhall endure throughout eternity; for the righteouſneſs of this Covenant, even the Surety-righteouſneſs of Chriſt the Redeemer, ſhall be worn in glory for evermore, by all the redeemed people; and through the force and vertue of the blood thereof, ſhall the glorious Church ſtand and reign for ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8, <hi>And to her was granted that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine linnen, clean and white; for the fine linnen is the righteouſneſs of Saints.</hi> And 5.9, <hi>And they ſung a new ſong, ſaying, thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Another Property of the Covenant of Redemption, is <hi>equality:</hi> They who diſtinguiſh Covenants into <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal</hi> Covenants; by equal Covenants they underſtand ſuch wherein there is equality in the parties or conditions, when the parties ſtand in equal terms, and do agree upon equal or like conditions.</p>
               <p>No Covenant betwixt God and meer Man, ean properly and ſtrictly be called an equal Covenant; neither the Covenant of works made with man in his integrity, nor the Covenant of Grace made with fallen man; for beſide the infinite diſtance and inequality of the parties, there is no proportion betwixt the terms and conditions given and required in theſe Covenants: And upon ſtrict examination, there are but few equal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants betwixt man and man; for it is rare to find the condition and affairs of Parties entering in Covenant in ſuch an equal poiſe, as that the inequality of their condition, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and exigent of their affairs, does not influence the terms and conditions of their Covenants, ſo as to render them unequal.</p>
               <p>But ſure the Covenant betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, is an <hi>equal</hi> Covenant. 1. This Covenant was betwixt <hi>parties</hi> equal; I do not ſay that the Man Chriſt, or Chriſt Mediator was equal with God; for in this reſpect there was an inferiority and ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto which Chriſt <hi>humbled himſelf,</hi> by giving his actual conſent in this Covenant unto the deſignation of him to be the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58137:47"/>Perſon that ſhould do the work of our Redemption; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Chriſt as the eternal Son of God, and antecedently to his actual conſent to humble himſelf; yea, and after that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent too, conſidering Chriſt the ſecond Perſon as the natural Son of God, the parties tranſacting this Covenant (though not <hi>quatenus,</hi> as they were conſidered in this Covenant-tranſaction) were equal in Power, Greatneſs, Wiſdom, Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as hath been before ſhewed from <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Joh. 10.29, 30, <hi>My Father which gave them me, is greater than all. —I and my Father are one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Covenant was betwixt equal parties, when they ſtood in <hi>equal terms,</hi> and were at a perfect freedom to chuſe or refuſe, to give conſent to this Covenant or refuſe it, as pleaſed either party; there may be ſometimes equality betwixt parties cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting; yet the inequality of the condition and freedom at the time of tranſacting, may render the Covenant betwixt them unequal; as when the one party is not at freedom, is concluded by ſome preſſure or neceſſity that is not upon the other party; hence often the terms are unequal: but in the Covenant of Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip (whatſoever inequality and ſubordination was ſubſequent, by the tenor of this Covenant) at the time when it was tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from eternity, the parties ſtood both on equal terms, and were at perfect freedom to tranſact or not, as pleaſed either (as I have already proved); there was nothing in the condition of either party (abſtracting from the purpoſe of the parties own will, and the deſign that acted them, which was common to both) that could conclude either party to enter into ſuch a Covenant (If I may call a tranſaction that had no beginning, by the name of entering a Covenant in regard of our manner of conceiving thereof); for this Covenant was not only conſented to by Chriſt, a perſon equal with God; but by him <hi>being in the form of God,</hi> Phil. 2.6, 7, that is, while he ſtood in equal terms with God, and was under no neceſſity to be <hi>found in the form of a ſervant,</hi> till he <hi>humbled himſelf, and made himſelf of no reputation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>deſign</hi> that acted both parties in this tranſaction, was equal; for it was one and the ſame, a deſign of love acted both the Father and the Son; the carrying on a purpoſe of Grace and deſign of love which God had laid upon his elect people, acted
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58137:47"/>
                  <hi>Jehovah</hi> in ſending Chriſt to do this work of Redemption, and in making him Surety for his people; and the ſame deſign alſo acted Chriſt in his conſenting to take our Law-place, and in his coming accordingly to act our part, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> With <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20,—<hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> Even this Love-deſign which took up the delight and the thoughts of both the patties equally, and wherewith both parties were ſolacing themſelves in the works without themſelves; when as yet there was no world, nor Inhabitants thereof created, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31, <hi>Rejoycing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This Covenant of Suretiſhip was made upon equal or like <hi>conditions</hi> and terms; there was an equality betwixt the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſtipulation; the conditions promiſed to Chriſt, and theſe required from him by this Covenant; not that worthleſs man was a wager for God to work for; for he was far below the price that love put upon him. But underſtand it thus, 1. There was an equality of <hi>Juſtice</hi> betwixt the conditions on the one part and the other; <hi>punitive Juſtice</hi> could exact no more of man, by the curſe of the broken Covenant, than that which Chriſt ſuffered as his Surety, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us;</hi> and <hi>remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Juſtice</hi> could give no leſs to his perfect obedience unto the Law of works, than the righteouſneſs and life which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4, <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> 2. There was an equality of <hi>proportion</hi> or <hi>merit</hi> betwixt the conditions required from, and performed by Chriſt, by vertue of this Covenant, and the conditions promiſed and performed unto Chriſt by this Covenant. Not a merit and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction upon Chriſt's part <hi>de congruo</hi> (as the Schoolmen ſpeak) whereby the friendſhip and love of the party injured doth accept of that which is not equivalent to the offence,<note place="margin">Durand. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>diſt.</hi> 21. <hi>queſt.</hi> 2.</note> which <hi>Vorſtius</hi> calleth God's Divine <hi>acceptilation</hi> (which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had no place here, though the friendſhip and love betwixt God and Chriſt, be ſuch as renders any thing done by him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable); but a merit and ſatisfaction <hi>de condigno,</hi> there being a juſt and equal proportion betwixt the fault committed, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58137:48"/>the ſatisfaction given, and betwixt the reward promiſed and given to Chriſt, and the obedience required from and performed by him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, 5, <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do. And now, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf.</hi> Phil. 2.7, 8, <hi>But made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of man. And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf. —Wherefore God hath highly exalted him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>advantage</hi> redounding to both parties by this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is equal; I mean, the glory and honour of this tranſaction; for no other profit and goodneſs can redound unto the all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient good, <hi>Job.</hi> 35.7, <hi>If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</hi> Pſal. 16.2, 3,—<hi>My goodneſs extendeth not unto thee: But to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</hi> I ſay of the Covenant of Suretiſhip, that though the profit is ours, and extendeth only to the redeemed people; yet the advantage of honour and glory, doth equally reach both the parties tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting <hi>in their own order;</hi> for thereby there is a peculiar honour of our Redemption and Salvation to God, the <hi>Author</hi> thereof, who gave Chriſt, and ſent him to work this Redemption; and a peculiar honour to Chriſt Mediator, to the Lamb the <hi>grand Inſtrument</hi> that wrought it, and whoſe ſoul travelled in it. So that the honour accrewing hereby is not peculiar to any one of the parties, but parted betwixt them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23, <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</hi> Rev. 7.10, <hi>And cryed with a loud voice, ſaying, Salvation unto our God which ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Another Property of the Covenant of Redemption, is <hi>order:</hi> that which is ſaid of the Covenant of Reconciliation, that it's <hi>ordered in all things;</hi> is eminently true of the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: It is a well-ordered Covenant; and how can it be made otherwiſe, ſince he that made it is <hi>the God of order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33. and <hi>God only wiſe,</hi> 1. Tim. 1.17. who knew well how to contrive the comely order which he deſigned. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this Covenant doth chiefly conſiſt in theſe two things. 1. In God's beautiful contriving and ordering the methods and ways of our Redemption and Salvation. 2. In his comely order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and adapting theſe Methods of Redemption to anſwer the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58137:48"/>ends and intents, which were purpoſed and propoſed in this tranſaction. Under the firſt of theſe, I comprehend, 1. His ordering and ſending of a Saviour and Redeemer to fallen man. 2. His ordering the things that the Perſon deſigned ſhould do and ſuffer for purchaſing this Redemption. 3. His ordering the means whereby the purchaſed Redemption ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Redeemed people. 4. His ordering the efficacy of means towards the ends purpoſed by him, that there might be no miſgiving in all the matter. Under the fecond, I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend God's ordering, 1. That the ſatisfaction of Divine Juſtice ſhall be, by a Surety. 2. That the ſatisfaction of the Surety ſhall meet with, and fully come up to the demands of the Law and Covenant of works, by his obeying the command, and bearing the curſe. 3. That the Sureties ſatisfaction ſhall ſtand for the broken man's; he taking our Law-place upon him, and acting our part. 4. That Juſtice ſhall be ſo ſatisfied, as mercy be alſo entreated; that the means and methods of Redemption, may anſwer the intent of God, to glorifie theſe two attributes, Juſtice and Mercy, in Man's Redemption. I do not ſay that the beautiful order of this Covenant conſiſted in theſe things only; but in theſe, and the like; which will appear further, when we come to ſpeak of the ſubject-matter of this Covenant, and the things that were therein concluded.</p>

Although God be on both ſides of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; yet God is not to be the ſame way conſidered upon both parts of the Covenant; for upon the one part God is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered <hi>eſſentially,</hi> and it is <hi>opus eſſentiale,</hi> an act common to all the three Perſons of the Godhead. The one party covenanting is <hi>Jehovah;</hi> God is common to all the three: upon the other part the Son of God is to be conſidered <hi>perſonally,</hi> an act pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon; elſe there could be no diſtinction of parties, no diſtinction of conſents, and conſequently no Covenant of Redemption, no compact about that work; and according to this diſtinction, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scriptures before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 2. The Covenant of Redemption is tranſacted with Chriſt <hi>perſonal,</hi> not with Chriſt <hi>myſtical,</hi> not with the elect Company, but ſingly with the <hi>Captain of Salvation;</hi> not with the head and body, the Church; but with the choſen head, unto whom God promiſed and had appointed a numerous ſeed, that ſhould become a body to him. It was made with Chriſt, not as a publick perſon, repreſenting many; but as an eminent choſen perſon, choſen out among his brethren, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19, <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one choſen out of the people.</hi> Heb. 5.1, <hi>For every high prieſt taken from among men, is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and ſacrifices for ſin;</hi> for though the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body of Chriſt were to reap the benefit of this tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; yet they were not parties in the tranſacting their own Redemption. The Covenant of peace, kindneſs, reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and life, was indeed made with Chriſt myſtical, head and members; with him as a publick perſon, repreſenting all his ſeed and heirs that were choſen in him; but the Covenant of Redemption was not ſo.</p>
               <p>Theſe things confirm this Aſſertion. 1. The work and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs tranſacted by this Covenant, was peculiar to Chriſt's perſon, the ſatisfying divine Juſtice, by paying a price; the act of Suretiſhip, and taking the broken-man's Law-place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sure this was peculiar to Chriſt perſonal. 2. It was he to whom a ſeed of his own begetting, comprehending all the elect, was promiſed; to whom a bride and a body, whereof he ſhould be head and husband, with whom this Covenant was tranſacted. Now this was Chriſts perſonal: for it could not be, that God
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58137:50"/>promiſed this ſeed to the ſeed; he did not promiſe a people to themſelves; but to Chriſt their choſen head. 3. By this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, God did promiſe and give the headſhip to Chriſt over that body, and did veſt him with powers and authorities ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; even with all power in Heaven and Earth: Now the headſhip and theſe great Authorities, were neither promiſed nor given to the head and body, to Chriſt myſtical; but to Chriſt perſonal. 4. Chriſt plainly claims the work of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to himſelf ſingly and perſonally conſidered, and leaving out all others, even his own body, as having no acceſſion to this that he was ſingly engaged in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10, <hi>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things; in bringing many Sons to glory, to make the Captain of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation perfect through ſuffering.</hi> And 5.9, <hi>And being made perfect, he became the Author of eternal Salvation unto all them that obey him.</hi> Joh. 17.4, <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> Iſa. 63.3, <hi>I have trodden the wine preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 3. The Covenant of Redemption which was tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with Chriſt perſonally conſidered, even with the only Son of God, the ſecond perſon: was not made with <hi>Chriſt God;</hi> but with Chriſt <hi>God-man;</hi> the perſon tranſacting with <hi>Jehovah,</hi> was not the Son of God, conſidered as <hi>God,</hi> as the natural Son of God; but conſidered as <hi>God-man,</hi> as Mediator; this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was ſtricken with Chriſt <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And 1. That it was not made with <hi>Chriſt God,</hi> or conſidered as the natural only Son of God, is manifeſt: For, 1. Chriſt God could not be under the Law. 2. Nor repreſent man, and take his Law-place. 3. Nor can Chriſt God ſuffer and pay a price of blood. 4. Nor could Chriſt God receive a Miſſion and Mandates; he could not be a Meſſenger, nor be ſent, if we ſpeak properly. 5. Nor to Chriſt God could there be promiſes made, or any reward given, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe, and many ſuch inſtances may ſerve for eſtabliſhing the negative part of this Aſſertion; to wit, that the Covenant of Redemption was not made with Chriſt God: beſide, that this will receive further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation by eſtabliſhing the affirmative part of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Covenant of Redemption was made with Chriſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58137:51"/>
                  <hi>God-man:</hi> For, 1. In this reſpect only, Chriſt could make a party diſtinct from the other party covenanting; to wit, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah;</hi> it could not have been a Covenant except there had been two parties agreeing together. Now <hi>Chriſt God,</hi> the ſecond perſon, could not conſtitute a party covenanting diſtinct from God conſidered eſſentially, as common to all the three, Father, Son and Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30, <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> It was therefore Chriſt God-man, that made the Covenant of Redemption. 2. Chriſt had a will diſtinct from <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s will, only as he was <hi>God-man:</hi> for as <hi>God,</hi> his will is one and the ſame with his Father's will, and undiſtinguiſhed from it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13, <hi>Not of the will of man; but of God.</hi> Now where there is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betwixt two, there muſt be two wills, elſe how can there be any agreement or conſent of two; for conſent is an act of the will: It follows therefore, that the Covenant was made with Chriſt <hi>God-man,</hi> ſince in this reſpect only, there are two wills meeting, conſenting, and agreeing on the ſame thing. 3. In what reſpect only Chriſt had a will capable of howing, yielding, and obeying, in that reſpect he is to be conſidered in the Covenant of Redemption; whereby he voluntarily yielded to do theſe things, which no natural neceſſity obliged him to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Then ſaid I, lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.</hi> Now it is evident, that Chriſt only as he was <hi>God man,</hi> had a will capable of howing and yielding, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30, <hi>Nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt;</hi> for the will of Chriſt as God was not capable of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and yielding, <hi>for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Rom. 9.19. the Govenant therefore was made with Chriſt <hi>God-man.</hi> 4. In what reſpect Chriſt was inferiour to God, or ſubordinate to him, and did receive offices, truſt, miſſion, commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and did obey: In that reſpect only, was the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtricken with him; for by the tenor of that Covenant he did all theſe things, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18, <hi>This commandment have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of my Father.</hi> And 6.38, 39, <hi>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me. And this is the fathers will that hath ſent me.</hi> And it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that in this reſpect only, Chriſt as <hi>God-man</hi> is inferior to God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.28, <hi>My Father is greater then I;</hi> for Chriſt God is equal with his Father, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. It follows therefore neceſſarily, that the Covenant of Redemption was made with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58137:51"/>Chriſt <hi>God-man.</hi> 5. In this conſideration only as Chriſt is <hi>God-man,</hi> the conditions and ſatisfaction performed by him, are performed by one party, and accepted by another; in this reſpect only there is ſending and coming, asking and receiving, commanding and obeying, giving ſatisfaction and receiving it; for if Chriſt be conſidered as God, then there could be no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and accepting of ſatisfaction; for ſo the party giving and receiving, ſending and going, working and rewarding, being the ſame, all ſatisfaction is taken away; for the party the ſame every way, cannot be the giver and receiver of the ſatisfaction; ſo all diſtinction of parties is taken away, and conſequently all Covenant-dealings enervated. 6. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption muſt be with Chriſt <hi>God-man,</hi> in regard that the ſatisfaction required upon God's part to be performed by Chriſt, and undertaken by him, was ſuch as might ſtand in Law for our ſin. Now it is not imaginable how the ſatisfaction of Chriſt <hi>God,</hi> could meet with the curſe of the Law of works that had gone forth againſt man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, <hi>But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> It reſts therefore, that it was a ſatisfaction undertaken by <hi>God-man</hi> in the Covenant of Redemption. 7. In that conſideration that Chriſt was Surety for his people, and Mediator betwixt God and man; in the ſame conſideration was the Covenant of Suretiſhip and Redemption made with him; for he could not he a Surety in one reſpect, and act himſelf unto it in another; but it is plain Scripture that it was not Chriſt <hi>God</hi> that was Mediator and Surety; but Chriſt <hi>God-man,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5, <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Heb. 7.22, <hi>By ſo much was Jeſus made ſurety of a better teſtament.</hi> 8. In what conſideration Chriſt did perform the Covenant of Redemption, in the ſame reſpect he is to be conſidered as a party undertaker (for no man can probably think that one party undertook, and another performed); but it is above queſtion, that Chriſt <hi>God-man</hi> did perform this Covenant, and fulfil the conditions therein required, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, <hi>And without controverſie, great is the myſterie of Godlineſs, God was manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeen of angels, weached unto the gentiles, believed on in the world, received up
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58137:52"/>into glory:</hi> Gal. 4.4, <hi>But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the draw.</hi> Rom. 8.3, <hi>For what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> I conclude therefore, that with Chriſt <hi>God man</hi> was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption made. Beſides theſe arguments, many more might be framed, from the particular commands, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and promiſes of the Covenant of Redemption, which are competent only to Chriſt <hi>God-man,</hi> and no ways to Chriſt <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this which hath been ſaid of Chriſt conſidered as <hi>God</hi> and as <hi>God-man,</hi> we may anſwer the queſtion, How the Juſtice of God can have a ſatisfaction from, and by a perſon or party who is God? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If Chriſt God had been the party with whom the Covenant of Redemption had been tranſacted, then indeed the party giving, and the party receiving the ſatisfaction, had been the ſame. But the Covenant being made with Chriſt <hi>God-man,</hi> a perſon different from offended God eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially conſidered; ſo it is another party that makes the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, than the party which was offended, and doth receive the ſatisfaction. 2. Chriſt <hi>God-man</hi> in one perſon, having man's nature that offended, united into a perſonal union with the Godhead; was thereby fitted ſo to ſtand in our place, and upon our ſide, as a party different from God, that he might therein ſatisfie wrath, and therein merit by making a full and real compenſation to offended Juſtice. 3. Chriſt <hi>God-man,</hi> who makes the ſatisfaction as he is God, being one with the Father, while he ſatisfies the Father's Juſtice, he ſatisfies his own; but as he is <hi>God-man,</hi> being a party different from the Father, he is by the Soveraignty of free Grace given to be a Surety; and the ſatisfaction which he makes in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as our Surety, is accepted by his Father, as by another party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 4. Chriſt was choſen and predeſtinated Lord Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and we are choſen in him before he is a party cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with <hi>Jehovah,</hi> about the work of our Redemption: I ſay, 1. He is firſt in order, in the eternal purpoſe of God, deſigned and ſet apart to do this work, before he gave an actual conſent unto the Covenant of Suretiſhip. This followeth neceſſarily upon the former Aſſertion; for if the Covenant
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58137:52"/>be made with Chriſt <hi>God-man,</hi> with Chriſt Mediator betwixt God and man, then he muſt needs be Mediator by ſome eternal act of the counſel of God antecedent in order of nature to this Covenant with him, which is made with him conſidered as God to be made manifeſt in the fleſh. 2. I ſay, not only Chriſt is choſen; but we alſo are choſen in him, unto the fruit of that great labour and ſervice which he was deſigned to undergo; for a Covenant of Suretiſhip and Redemption, does not only ſuppoſe a Redeemer and Surety predeſtinated to be undertaker for a loſt people; but alſo a people deſigned to be partakers of the Redemption which he was to work. So that I ſay, this Covenant that was made with Chriſt <hi>God-man;</hi> does ſuppoſe Chriſt's headſhip, and our member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by eternal predeſtination, and by a co-ordination, which may be expreſs'd in this order; firſt, the choſen head, and then the body; God did not not firſt chuſe a body, and then had a head to ſeek for them; nor did he chuſe a head to be without a body, or as one that knew not of a body for that head; but Election, which was the firſt act of God's love in eternity, fell firſt upon Chriſt, whom God did chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> to be the head of his body the Church, and the Captain of Salvation to all the choſen company; and having choſen him, he chuſed us in him, as our head, and as the firſt-born of the elect houſe and family, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, <hi>For whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate, to be conformed to the Image of his Son, that he might be the firſt born among many brethren.</hi> Eph. 1.4, <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love.</hi>

By this Covenant it was agreed betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt <hi>God-man,</hi> who ſhould be the Redeemed people; there was a definite certain number of Redeemed ones agreed upon, for whom Chriſt ſhould pay a price; he was not Surety and undertaker for all Mankind, nor for all the viſible Church to whom the Goſpel ſhall be preached; for his undertaking is no wider nor larger than his dying, purchaſing Redemption, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iniquity, Praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe being of equal extent and efficacy: for whom Chriſt was undertaker to his Father, for them he dyed, and purchaſed Redemption by his death; for them he did pray and make interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58137:53"/>that he did not purchaſe Redemption, and make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for all Mankind; but for a choſen people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, that by means of death for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they who are called might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi> Joh. 17.9, <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them that thou haſt given me; for they are thine.</hi> Neither was Chriſt undertaker for a people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any general notions or qualifications (ſuch as them that ſhould believe in him, or the like), not knowing definitely who the perſons were: but he was Surety and undertaker only for the elect, and for a definite number of people, who were by number and name given to him by his Father, and received by him, to be redeemed by his blood; which doth plainly appear by the deſcription of the Redeemed people, who are ordinarily called <hi>thoſe whom the Father gave unto Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 17.3, 6, 9, 11. &amp; 6.37, 39. and who were <hi>choſen in him,</hi> Eph. 1.4. and <hi>whoſe names are written in the book of life,</hi> and <hi>in the Lambs book of life;</hi> as if the Father, who gave them to Chriſt, had kept one record of their number and names, and the Lord Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, who undertook for them, had kept another; <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. and 21.27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this Covenant it was agreed betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, who ſhould be the Redeemer; I ſay, it was agreed who ſhould be the perſon to undertake this great work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation for theſe elect people; for although we may conceive that Chriſt was predeſtinated unto this work before his actual conſent; yet we muſt conceive the agreement is by his own actual conſent and compact with God. See the agreement and conſent of both the parties, that Chriſt ſhall be the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> his ſervant in this work, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.5, 6, <hi>And now ſaith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his ſervant, to bring Jacob again to him; though Iſrael be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength. And he ſaid, it is a light thing that thou ſhouldſt be my ſervant, to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael; I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my ſalvation unto the end of the earth.</hi> And under this part of the agreement, I comprehend, 1. The deſignation of the perſon who ſhall be the redeemer, that it ſhall be the ſecond perſon, the Son of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58137:54"/>God only, not the Father, nor the Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20, <hi>And the Redeemer ſhall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion in Jacob, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Act. 3.26, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning away every one of you from his Iniquities.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9, <hi>God ſent his only begotten Son unto the world, that we might live through him.</hi> 2. The conſtituting of that Perſon, Surety and Mediator to take that place upon him, which the work of our Redemption did require, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22, <hi>By ſo much was Jeſus made a ſurety of a better teſtament.</hi> 3. The conſent and agreement of Chriſt to both theſe, to be the perſon that ſhall work this work, and to be ſubſtitute in this place for doing the work, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, <hi>Then ſaid I, lo I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God;</hi> thus did the Creditor and the Cautioner ſtrike hands together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this Covenant it was agreed betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, What ſhould be the Redeemer's work; or what ſhould be the price that he ſhould pay, and the ſatisfaction that he ſhould make to divine Juſtice, for the ſins of the elect that were given to him; under this, I take in, 1. The concluding betwixt the parties, that Chriſt ſhall take upon him our Law-place and room, and in order to that his taking our nature upon him, that Juſtice might reach him in our ſtead and place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law.</hi> 2. That Chriſt as our Surety ſhould dye, and lay down his life for us, that he ſhould pay for us the whole ſum that was owing; even all that the Law and Juſtice could exact of the broken man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18, <hi>No man taketh is from me; but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi> Rom. 8.3, <hi>God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> Gal. 3.13, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us;</hi> this is at length held forth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5, 6, 7, 10, 12. 3. That the payment and ſatisfaction that ſhould be made to Juſtice, by our Surety in our nature, and in our room, ſhould be accepted as our payment, and as a condign price for our right to Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the new Teſtament, that by means of death for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By this Covenant it was agreed betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58137:54"/>Chriſt, what ſhould be the term of paying this price, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this ſatisfaction to Juſtice. A time and term-day is conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended upon, ſuch as ſeemed fit to infinite wiſdom to appoint, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.2, 4,—<hi>until the time appointed of the Father.—but when the fulneſs of the time was come.</hi> Heb. 9.10, 11, <hi>until the time of reformation. But Chriſt being come, an high prieſt of good things to come.</hi> Dan. 9.26, <hi>And after threeſcore and two weeks ſhall Meſſiah be cut off; but not for himſelf.</hi> I ſay, though the price was agreed upon from eternity; yet God in his wiſdom thought fit to put off the time of actual paying this price, till the Redeemer that ſhould come out of <hi>Zion</hi> ſhould be long waited for, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.38,—<hi>and ſpake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jeruſalem;</hi> but though the payment was ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded till the fulneſs of time; yet neither Chriſt's acting as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, nor the force of the blood of this Covenant; but in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the price to be payed at <hi>the time appointed by the Father, he was the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> Rev. 13.8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By this Covenant it was agreed betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, how the Redemption wrought by him ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to his elect people. And under this, I comprehend, 1. The eternal appointment of the Goſpel-Ordinances, eſpecially the Covenant of Grace and Reconciliation, as means by divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, fitted to give the knowledge of the Redeemer, and of the Redemption and Salvation wrought by him, <hi>Luk</hi> 1.77, 78, 79, <hi>To give knowledg of Salvation unto his people, by the remiſſion of their ſins: Through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-ſpring from an high hath viſited us; To give light to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, to guide our feet in the way of peace.</hi> 2. The concluſion, that the Goſpel ſhould be preached to all Nations; that for the Elect's ſake it might come unto all the Societies of men in the world, among whom there are any of the redeemed ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2, <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend the rod of thy ſtrength out of Zion, rule thou in the midſt of thine enemies.</hi> 3. The appointment of the times and ſeaſons, and of the particular Inſtruments that ſhould carry the Goſpel to the bounds of each elect Soul's habitation, that it might meet with them, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26, 27, <hi>And hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation. That they ſhould ſeek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58137:55"/>as we ſee it brought to paſs in the execution, ſo it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from eternity, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.29. and 2.6, 17. and 9.15. and 18.9, 10. 4. The pouring out of the Spirit to make the Goſpel-ordinances and means of Salvation effectual to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed people; this alſo was comprehended under this Article of the agreement, that this ſhould be procured by him, for his elect people, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7, 8, <hi>Nevertheleſs I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of fin, and of righteouſneſs, and of judgment.</hi> Pſal. 110.3, <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holineſs from the womb of the morning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. By this Covenant it was agreed betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, what ſhould be the reward and wages that he ſhould have for this great Service, for working the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; his reward and wages in the general Notation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was, <hi>ask and have;</hi> it was a grant of whatſoever he would ask of God for ſo great a work and ſervice; his recompence was at his own asking, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8, <hi>Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee,</hi> &amp;c. and according to his own heart, full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſatisfaction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, <hi>He ſhall be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> &amp;c. but more particularly, his reward and wages, which was all his own asking, compriſed theſe three things (which ſpeaks theſe particulars to have been much upon his heart, and in his deſign). 1. That he ſhould have a ſeed, and a people; that for all his labour he might have a redeemed people: when he had his reward and ſatisfaction at his own asking, he made the redeemed ones, his end, his asking, his ſatisfaction; this was the reſult of his tranſcendent love, that he might be <hi>Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, God with us;</hi> that he might enjoy his poor worthleſs people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11, <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief: when thou ſhalt make his Soul an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord-ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his Soul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> 2. That he might have a Crown to himſelf; I mean, a peculiar glory of being Lord Mediator and Redeemer, and of working this great work; and this he had in Heaven before the foundation of the world, even ſince the eternal deſignation and deſtination
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58137:55"/>of him unto this work; for thenceforward he was <hi>the Lamb of God ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> Rev. 13.8. And <hi>was ſet up from everlaſting,</hi> Prov. 8.23, and was glorified with the Father, not only with the eſſential glory that is common to all the three perſons, which was obſcured in his humiliation for the work of Redemption; but alſo with a peculiar <hi>glory,</hi> as Lord Mediator, <hi>which he had with him before the world began,</hi> Joh. 17.5. and this glory he ſhall have in Heaven, throughout eternity, even after the laſt Judgment, there ſhall be in Heaven a peculiar throne, and glory following, and a peculiar ſong to the Lamb; whereof read <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3. and 7.10, 17. and 5.9. 3. That he might have a crown and throne for each of theſe redeemed ones, whom he took for a ſatisfaction to his Soul, their crown, and throne, and robes was part of the reward and wages that he wrought for, and asked of his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> And 14.3, <hi>I will come again and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi> Luk. 12.32, <hi>Fear not little flock; for it is your father's good pleaſure to give you the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Rev. 3.21, <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit in my throne with me; even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. By this Covenant it was agreed betwixt the parties, what ſhould be the mutual aſſurances given betwixt the parties for the performance of the Articles agreed upon. There needed no Solemnities betwixt parties who knew one another, and truſted one another ſo perfectly; but for our ſakes, that we might be helped to conceive of this eternal inviolable tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Therefore upon the one part, 1. <hi>Jehovah</hi> giveth his word and faithful promiſe unto Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1, <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord;</hi> and not his faithful promiſe only, but his oath alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.35, <hi>Once have I ſworn by my holineſs, that I will not lye unto David.</hi> Heb. 7.21, <hi>For thoſe prieſts were made without an oath, but this with an oath, by him that ſaid unto him, The Lord ſwore, and will not repent, Thou art a prieſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedee.</hi> 2. Upon the other part, Chriſt does not only give his word of promiſe and conſent to do this work, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſire, mine ears haſt thou opened, burnt offering and ſin-offering haſt thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:58137:56"/>&amp;c. But he alſo comes under a Judicial and Law-act of Suretiſhip, whereby he did from eternity act himſelf, <hi>in the volume of the book</hi> of God's eternal Records, that he would ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil all his undertaking, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, <hi>Then ſaid I, lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God.</hi> And under this act of Suretiſhip, I comprehend, 1. His eternal conſent to take our Nature and Law-condition upon him. 2. His plighting of his faith and truth to act our part, and to anſwer the Law, and Demands of Juſtice in our Law-place and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 3. His eternal agreement that by his own conſent a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial act ſhould be put upon him, and ſtand in record for ever in Heaven, and in the volume of books that are there, that this perſon had voluntarily undertaken, and promiſed by ſtriking hands with <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to anſwer all demands of Law and Juſtice againſt his elect people.</p>
               <p>Having offered the before-mentioned ſum of the Articles concluded and agreed upon the Covenant of Redemption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt; I come in the next place to diſtribute and divide that ſum, and the things compriſed under it, into the reciprocal and mutual engagements of the parties covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to wit, 1. What were the commands and conditions laid upon Chriſt, and voluntarily yielded unto by him, in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption. 2. What the promiſes and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that were given to Chriſt by the ſame Covenant.</p>
               <p>And, 1. Concerning the commands, conditions and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which were required of Chriſt Mediator by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Suretiſhip: I ſhall in theſe eight Aſſertions open the nature of them, and what they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 1. All the commands of the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are conditions; and are to be conſidered as <hi>ſuch,</hi> when they are laid upon Chriſt, who came not under commands, but upon terms and conditions. It is not ſo in God's Covenant-dealings with us, all the commands of the Goſpel are not to us conditions of righteouſneſs and life (unleſs we underſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in a very large and improper ſenſe); neither is it of the eſſence of commands laid upon us to be conditions; for God oweth nothing to our obedience, nor is he obliged to make any promiſes to it; but the commands of the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are all of them conditions of that ſame Covenant: For, 1. They are commands, to the obedience whereof, promiſes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58137:56"/>are made, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12, <hi>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death, and he was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the tranſgreſſors, and he bare the ſin of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> 2. They are commands unto which Chriſt yielded upon terms, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8, <hi>But made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and was made in the likeneſs of man. And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs; therefore God hath highly exalted him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 2. All the conditions of the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; both theſe more general of obeying the Law, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling all righteouſneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15, <hi>For thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteauſneſs;</hi> and the more ſpecial condition of laying down his life, were voluntary free acts of Chriſt's will and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love, wherein he was acted by no neceſſity, without his own free conſent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18, <hi>No man taketh my life from me; but I lay it down of my ſelf; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again; this commandment have I received of my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 3. All the conditions required of Chriſt, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by him in the Covenant of Redemption, were enſured and certain conditions, there was no hazard of failing, nor coming ſhort upon his part in any the commands or conditions of that Covenant: therefore it was ſaid of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.4, <hi>He ſhall not fail, nor be diſcouraged till he have ſet judgment in the earth.</hi> Three things evidence this. 1. The perſonal union of the two Natures, exempted the man Chriſt from all hazard and poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſinning or coming ſhort in the obedience of any command or condition required of him. 2. Chriſt as man had the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit above meaſure, and the confirming Grace which is given to elect Angels in their head Chriſt; he had not only the promiſe of the Spirit and heavenly influences to all duties and conditions required of him; but he had theſe actually, even from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, <hi>I will put my ſpirit upon him:</hi> Iſa. 11.2, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him.</hi> 3. There were no threatnings in the Covenant of Redemption (though there were promiſes); becauſe there was no hazard of Chriſt's failing in the conditions thereof; nor poſſibility of his falling ſhort of the promiſed reward.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:58137:57"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 4. Although it was eminent pure Grace that made the Covenant of Redemption; yet the conditions thereof required from Chriſt, were works; it was doing, not believing, that was required of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19, <hi>By the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> Joh. 9.4, <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me.</hi> I acknowledg there was a kind of faith required of Chriſt-man, which cannot be excluded the conditions of this Covenant (underſtanding conditions in that large ſenſe as comprehending all theſe tyes, obligations and duties which the man Chriſt took upon him, by taking on our Nature, and our Law-place); whereof he maketh profeſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.7, <hi>For the Lord God will help me, therefore ſhall I not be confounded; therefore have I ſet my face like a flint, and I know that I ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8, <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me; becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved,</hi> &amp;c. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.25, <hi>for David ſpeaketh concerning him, I foreſaw the Lord always before my face; for he is on my right hand, that I ſhould not be moved.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13, <hi>I will put my truſt in him.</hi> But, 1. This faith profeſſed by Chriſt, was faith of another kind, than that faith which is the condition of the Goſpel-covenant to us; it was the faith of dependance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on God, for aſſiſtance and acceptance in doing the work, which was the eminent condition of the Covenant of Suretiſhip; but not a faith whereby he went out of himſelf to rely on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for righteouſneſs; it was works, not Grace; not the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Inſtrument, but the act and work of faith. 2. This faith profeſſed by Chriſt, was upon another account, and for another uſe; it was a debt which the holy humane nature of Chriſt, being a creature, owed unto God; a debt, I ſay, ſuch as did not exclude that from being meritorious, and part of his ſatisfaction (ſince it was part of his obedience taken on by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary compact) no more than his being made under the Law, whereby he was debtor to ſatisfie the penalty thereof, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his ſuffering from being ſatisfactory; yet he was not by this kind of believing juſtified, and conſtituted righteous, by any righteouſneſs received by his faith, or imputed to him; as we are juſtified by faith. 3. This faith profeſſed by Chriſt, was neither the whole condition of the Covenant of Suretiſhip, nor the chief and eminent part of it (as ſhall be made to appear); but at moſt it could amount to no more of the condition of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58137:57"/>his Suretiſhip, than ſuch a faith of dependency in <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall, ſhould have been in the conditional part of the Covenant of works that was made with him, and that was but one ſingle act and work of righteouſneſs; which was a ſmall part of the condition of that Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 5. The conditions of the Covenant of Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip made with Chriſt, did fully and perfectly anſwer the intent of the Covenant of works; and that in both the parts of it copulatively, which did but alternatively oblige man; for the Law does not oblige man in an abſolute ſenſe, both to perfect doing and ſuffering, but to one of them; for if we keepthe Law, we are not obliged to ſuffer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17, <hi>But of the tree of the knowledg of good and evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> But Chriſt by the conditions of the Covenant of Redemption, 1. He is a full doer and obedient fulfiller of the commands thereof in all points, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15, <hi>For thus it behoveth us to fulfil all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> 2. He fully ſuffers the penalty of that Covenant, and ſatisfies for the broken commands thereof, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5, 6, <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions.—The Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all.</hi> Hence, 3. By the conditions of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which he performed, he had right to Law-juſtification, and life eternal, even by the Law of works; for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which he wrought was perfect Law-righteouſneſs, though the imputation of it to us be an act of Grace; and our receiving it by faith, make it Goſpel-righteouſneſs to us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7, <hi>But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> Compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 6. Neither Chriſt's active nor paſſive obedience are to be excluded from making up the adequate condition of the Covenant of Suretiſhip: For, 1. The man Chriſt his paſſive obedience could not have amounted unto a ſatisfaction for us, if by his active obedience, his habitual and actual conformity unto the holy Law of God, he had not been <hi>ſuch a high prieſt as became us, as is holy, harmleſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. 2. Although Chriſt as man was obliged to obey the Moral Law; yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that he voluntarily took that obligation upon himſelf,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58137:58"/>and being Lord and Law giver, he made himſelf under the Law by this Covenant of Suretiſhip. I do not ſee how his obedience to the Law can be excluded from among the conditions of this Covenant. 3. The whole courſe of Chriſt's obedience, from his Birth to his Grave, by doing and ſuffering, is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the doing and ſuffering of ſo excellent a perſon who was <hi>God-man;</hi> and ſo all theſe being acts ſo excellent, and ſo undue (except by voluntary condeſcenſion), they muſt needs be ſuch conditions as were part of the price payed by him. 4. The obedience of Chriſt, and all that he did in obedience to the Law, being performed by him in the ſtate of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which he was, whatſoever he was, <hi>for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9, <hi>for your ſakes he became poor;</hi> all theſe muſt have reſpect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of his Covenant with <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which he performed for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 7. The conditions of the Covenant of Redemption required from Chriſt, and performed by him, were meritorious; that is, they were not conſequent conditions, which denote on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a connexion and order betwixt the thing promiſed, and the condition required; but they were antecedent conditions, when the condition is the cauſe of the thing promiſed; as in contracts of Juſtice, where one thing is given for another. So the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of this Covenant performed by Chriſt, did by order of ſtrict Juſtice, and <hi>jure emptionis,</hi> claim the reward that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and covenanted with him, to be given to himſelf the head, and to his elect people, in whoſe ſtead he ſatisfied Juſtice by paying their debt with a price of blood; hence it is that he craves the reward to be given, and that in Juſtice, for the work he had done, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, 5, 24, <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do. And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf.—Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold thy glory which thou haſt given me; for thou lovedſt me before the foundation of the world.</hi> Hence it is alſo, that his Advocation is grounded upon Juſtice, and he ſtands in Heaven, <hi>Jeſus the righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1. who being now juſtified and acquitted of the debt that he took upon him by his bond of Suretiſhip, whereby he was <hi>made ſin,</hi> and <hi>made a curſe</hi> for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. He pleads now the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of blood.</p>

                  <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 8. The condition of the Covenant of Suretiſhip, is either more general and <hi>adequate,</hi> or more ſpecial and <hi>forwal;</hi> and accordingly we muſt anſwer the queſtion, when 'tis asked, what was the condition of this Covenant? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>adequate</hi> condition of the Covenant of Suretiſhip can be no narrower than Chriſt's whole undertaking; ſo that whatſoever he undertook to do, whether in his own perſon, or in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for carrying on, and perfecting the word of Redemption from beginning to end, muſt be part of the conditions required at his hand; whereof read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, to 11. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, to 11; all which may be ſummed up in ſix compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive heads, 1. Chriſt's accepting the grand charge of this work of Redemption, even the Mediatory office that was put upon him; he receives the keys of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> the truſt and weight of the loſt, but elect world; and all the burthen and care of them is devolved upon him, with this office, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.22, 24. <hi>And the key of the houſe of David will I lay upon his ſhoulder; ſo he ſhall open, and none ſhall ſhut; and he ſhall ſhut, and none ſhall open: And they ſhall hang upon him all the glory of his Father's houſe, the off-ſpring and the iſſue; all veſſels of ſmall quantity, from the veſſels of cups, even to all tho veſſels of flaggons.</hi> 2. His taking out nature upon him, and that not in its primitive virgin integrity, but when it was at the worſt; it was a condition of this Covenant, that Chriſt ſhould humble himſelf to take on him <hi>the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3, that he ſhould take the ſame nature that offended divine Juſtice, even <hi>the ſame fleſh and blood,</hi> whereof the children are partakers, and no other, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. 3. His taking our Law-place, was another condition; not our nature only, but our Law-place and room; that is, to put his Soul in our Soul's ſtead, that the Law of God might reach him, who otherwiſe could not be reached by the Law; and that Divine Juſtice executing the curſe and penalty of the Law, might ſmite him, as the guilty man being by his own conſent, and his bond of Suretiſhip become legally the debtor and ſinner (though not intrinſecally), <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, <hi>made under the Law,</hi> and <hi>made ſin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. though <hi>he knew no ſin.</hi> 4. His acting our part, not in a ſcenick, but in a real manner; he came upon the ſtage to repreſent our perſon, and in our nature and Law-place he really acted our part; and this was another condition required of him, who
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58137:59"/>perfectly obeyed the command of the Law, and ſuffered the threatning thereof for us, even all that Juſtice had threatned to inflict upon the offender and tranſgreſſour of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. he was <hi>made a curſe for us,</hi> Iſa. 53.5, <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him,</hi> &amp;c. 5. His taking a new Covenant-right unto God his own Father, and not to God only, but to heaven, and glory, and all the New-covenant bleſſings, whereby the Covenant-right and rites of his redeemed people might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidated in him, as their head; and whereby he might for ever carry their names and intereſts before his Father, as being there repreſented by him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.26, <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of my Salvation.</hi> Heb. 2.11.13, <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one; for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And again, I will put my truſt in him; and again, behold I, and the children which thou haſt given me.</hi> And 9.24, <hi>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God, for us.</hi> 6. His effectual application of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchaſed by his Suretiſhip unto all his redeemed ones. And under this, I comprehend Chriſt's undertaking for the pouring out of the Spirit, to ſend to them his Spirit, to draw them to him, to cauſe them to believe &amp; receive his Surety-righteouſneſs, to keep them in his favour and love, to cauſe them to perſevere, to preſent them perfected, and without ſpot to God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26, <hi>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me.</hi> Joh. 12.32, <hi>And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me.</hi> Joh. 6.37, <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Joh. 6.39, 40, <hi>And this is the Father's will that hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day. And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Joh. 14.3, <hi>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But if ye enquire after the <hi>formal</hi> condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58137:59"/>of Suretiſhip, I ſay it was his whole obedience active and paſſive, even unto death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, <hi>and became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs;</hi> though the ſpecial, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>eminent</hi> condition of this Covenant may be referred to the principal, eminent, laſt act of his obedience to that ſignal ſpecial command of laying down his life for the elect, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18, <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again; this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment have I received of my Father.</hi> For, 1. This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being a bargain betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, of buying a people to God; then the whole price and ranſom told down and payed for them, muſt be the formal condition of that Covenant, whereby <hi>we are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. 1 Pet. 1.18, 19, <hi>For as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain converſation recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by tradition from your Fathers: but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without ſpot, and without blemiſh.</hi> 2. Chriſt was under a ſpecial explicite command for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this condition of laying down his life; as is clear from <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18, and Chriſt was under a ſpecial act to obey this command, as himſelf acknowledges, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, <hi>Then ſaid I, lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O my God;</hi> and therefore we may well call it the ſpecial condition of the Covenant of Suretiſhip. 3. This ſolemn act of obedience, in offering himſelf a Sacrifice to death for our ſins, is the condition of his bond of Suretiſhip, that is moſt notiſed by the Holy Ghoſt, and frequently referred unto; as may be gathered from <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, 15, 26, <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſciences from dead works, to ſerve the living God. And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, that by means of death for the Redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.—but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi> Rom. 8.3,—<hi>God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> And therefore when we ſpeak of the condition of the Covenant of Suretiſhip, this is to be held the ſpecial eminent condition thereof. 4. The Father of our
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58137:60"/>Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſtates the condition of this Covenant upon this eminent ſolemn act of his obedience, even his making <hi>his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> &amp;c. for-vent which he makes the great promiſes of his glorious reward, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. throughout. 5. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf does own this as the ſpecial condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Coovenant of Suretiſhip; and that both at his entring into the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 7, <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith, ſacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not; but a body haſt thou prepared me. Then ſaid I, lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God:</hi> And about, or at the time of his leaving the world, when he had fulfilled, or was about to fulfil all his undertaking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> With 19.30, <hi>When Jeſus therefore had received the vinegar, he ſaid, it is finiſhed, and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe being the ſum of the conditions required from Chriſt,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Rutherf.</hi> Treat. of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>p. 2. ch. 11.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Robert</hi>'s Medul. Bibl. <hi>b. 2. c. 2.</hi>
                  </note> and undertaken by him; let us enquire alſo after the promiſes made to Chriſt, and the encouraging-conditions that were made to him by <hi>Jehovah,</hi> for undertaking ſo hard a work as was the redemption and recovery of loſt man: Theſe were of eight ſorts.</p>
               <p>The firſt kind of promiſes made to Chriſt in the Covenant of Redemption, were ſuch as relate to the offices, authorities, truſts and powers that were covenanted to him, for the doing of this work. 1. I ſay, <hi>Jehovah</hi> promiſeth to inveſt Chriſt with offices ſutable to that great work of Redemption, to make him Lord Mediator of the new Covenant; to make him great Lord Ambaſſador, that he might go and travel in that buſineſs of our Redemption; to make him a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet, for effecting this buſineſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. throughout, <hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand,—he ſhall judge among the heathen,—the Lord hath ſworn, and will not repent, thou art a Priest for ever,</hi> Iſa. 49.6. And 42.6, 7, <hi>I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my Salvation unto the ends of the earth,—to open the blind eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6, 7, <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion; I will declare the decree, the Lord ſaid unto me,</hi> &amp;c. 2. God did not only promiſe to inveſt Chriſt with offices and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58137:60"/>truſts; but with authorities and powers alſo, with headſhip and power of Judgment over Men and Angels, that ſhall make them all bow to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10.11, <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the judgment ſeat of Christ; for it is written, As I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to God.</hi> He was not a titular King or Prieſt, nor a ſcenick one, a King upon a ſtage; but a King upon a throne, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.32, 33, <hi>And the Lord God ſhall give unto him the throne of his father David. And he ſhall reign over the houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there ſhall be no end.</hi> A King that had power to bow the hearts of his Subjects, and to cruſh the greateſt Heads and Rulers in the world that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3.5, 6, <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.—The Lord at thy right hand ſhall ſtrike through kings in the day of his wrath. He ſhall judg among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, he ſhall fill the places with the dead bodies, he ſhall wound the heads over many countries.</hi> And 2.9, <hi>Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in pieces like a potter's veſſel.</hi> And 45.3, 4, 5, <hi>Gird thy ſword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majeſty. And in thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ride proſperouſly, becauſe of truth and meekneſs, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and thy right hand ſhall teach thee terrible things. Thine arrows are ſharp in the heart of the kings enemies, whereby the people fall under thee.</hi> A perſon in offices, who had <hi>all judgment committed unto him,</hi> who had <hi>power given him over all fleſh,</hi> Joh. 17.2. and <hi>all power in heaven and earth,</hi> Mat. 28.18. this was he to whom all the honourable offices and abſolute powers of his Father's houſe was promiſed, that he might act and give orders, and ſet up, and put down, and none to controul him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.22, 24, <hi>And the key of the houſe of David, will I lay upon his ſhoulder, ſo he ſhall open and none ſhall ſhut, and he ſhall ſhut and none ſhall open. And they ſhall hang upon him all the Glory of his Father's houſe, the off-ſpring and the iſſue, all veſſels of ſmall quantity, from the veſſels of cups, even to all the veſſels of flaggons.</hi> 3. I ſay, the Lord Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator had all theſe offices and authorities by Covenant; the Lord promiſed to him, and covenanted with him to give him theſe offices, for doing the work of Redemption; therefore we read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. that Chriſt (who there is called <hi>David</hi>) is conſtituted a King by Covenant, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, and by what Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58137:61"/>even by that Covenant whereby the help of God's elect people was laid upon him, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and this was the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Suretiſhip and Redemption; and in the ſame place we read of the ſtanding faſt of God's Covenant with him, <hi>v.</hi> 28. even that Covenant whereby he was made higher than the Kings of the earth, <hi>v.</hi> 27. And again, we find the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant whereby he had a laſting Kingdom ſworn with him, <hi>v.</hi> 34, 35, <hi>My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips: Once have I ſworn by my holineſs, that I will not lye unto David.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe alſo, there is an oath interpoſed with the promiſe of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to ſhew that he was in that office by a more unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Covenant than that which was made with <hi>Levi,</hi> Mal. 2.5, <hi>My covenant with him was of life and peace;</hi> compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.21, <hi>For thoſe Prieſts were made without an oath; but this with an oath, by him that ſaid unto him, the Lord ſware and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever.</hi> The ſecond kind of Promiſes made to Chriſt, are ſuch as relate to the gifts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, and habitual furniture which was neceſſary unto the man Chriſt, for performing this great work; he had an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental fitneſs for this extraordinary work, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2, 3, 4, <hi>And the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall rest upon him, the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding, the ſpirit of counſel and might, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of knowledg, and of the fear of the Lord. And ſhall make him of quick underſtanding in the fear of the Lord: and he ſhall not judg after the ſight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears. But with righteouſneſs ſhall he judg the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he ſhall ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips ſhall he ſlay the wicked.</hi> And under this ſort of Promiſes, I comprehend, 1. The Sanctification of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be aſſumed by him, and infuſion of habitual Grace in the holy humane nature of Chriſt, from the very firſt moment of his conception, and of the perſonal union of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Luk</hi> 1.35, <hi>Therefore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> Heb. 7.26, <hi>For ſuch an high prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparated from ſinners, and made higher than the heavens.</hi> 2. The growth of Grace, whereof the man Chriſt was capable, who was made in all things like his brethren (except ſin); we muſt therefore
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58137:61"/>conceive of his growth, to have been without ſinful weakneſs, and to have been in experience, and in phyſical intention, and bendedneſs of acts of obedience, which the Law does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in like degree from the young as from the old, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52, <hi>And Jeſus increaſed in wiſdom and ſtature, and in favour with God and man.</hi> Heb. 5.8, <hi>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he ſuffered.</hi> Zech. 6.12, <hi>Behold the man whoſe name is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

The annointing in its fulneſs without meaſure, and above his fellows; whereby the man Chriſt was full of Grace, and had a fulneſs for this work, whereof no other creature was capable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2, 7,—<hi>Thou art fairer then the children of men; Grace is poured into thy lips; therefore God hath bleſſed thee for ever.—Thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows.</hi> Joh. 1.14, <hi>And the word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</hi> And 3. 34, <hi>for God giveth not the ſpirit by meaſure unto him.</hi> 4. The overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his fulneſs, whereby the Spirit and All-ſaving Grace, being placed in him as in a Store-houſe and Treaſure, not for himſelf only, but for his elect people; did run down and flow out from the Mediator, from Chriſt God-man, as water from a fountain and freſh ſpring, as dropping ſhowers from full clouds, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16, <hi>And of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi> Col. 2.3, <hi>In whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledg.</hi> And 1.19, <hi>But it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> 5. The bodily inhabitation of the fulneſs of the God-head in him: By vertue of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable myſterie of the perſonal union, he had a perſonal fulneſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9, <hi>for in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third kind of Promiſes made by <hi>Jehovah</hi> to Chriſt, and covenanted to him, were ſuch as relate to his actual ſupport in the execution of this office, and performing of the work which he undertook; for the man Chriſt being a creature, needed more than habitual Grace, and anointing with gifts for ſuch a work; there was a neceſſity that he ſhould not act inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently, without influence from God. And to this kind of promiſes may be referred the promiſes of heavenly influences
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58137:62"/>to all the acts of his Mediatory-office, and his Surety-obedience; ſo that as the man Chriſt needed the Spirit and Influences, theſe were enſured by Covenant unto him; ſo that it was impoſſible that the man Chriſt could ſin, or come ſhort in performing all his Father's pleaſure (as <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, and fell ſhort of the command), having actual influences enſured unto him, as well as habitual Grace: hence he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.32. and 8.16, <hi>I am not alone;</hi> it was impoſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58137:62"/>ſhepherd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and againſt the man that is my fellow, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Though he was forſaken for a time, and wanted influences of conſolation; and felt-fruition of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.45; yet theſe promiſes were verified to him, and God ſtood by him with influence of ſtrength, ſupport, aſſiſtance, and preſervation in all this Mediatory-adminiſtrations, till he ſaid, the work <hi>is finiſhed, Joh.</hi> 19.30. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9, <hi>But thou art he that took me out of the womb, thou didſt make me to hope when I was upon my mothers breaſts.</hi> 2. Againſt all oppoſitions and enemies: There was much oppoſition made to Chriſt, and many were againſt him; but againſt all the rage, plots, combinations of Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, the Lord ſtood by him, and ſet up his Kingdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2, 6, <hi>The kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the rulers take counſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his anointed;—Yet have I ſet my king upon my holy hill of Sion.</hi> Act. 4.27, 28, <hi>For of a truth againſt the holy child Jeſus, whom thou haſt anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Iſrael were gathered together, for to do whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel determined before to be done.</hi> 3. Againſt the deepeſt diſcouragements that he ſhould meet with in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his office: He is ſupported by theſe promiſes made to him, and accordingly he encourageth himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4, 5, 6, <hi>Then: ſaid I, I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for naught, and in vain; yet ſurely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work wiith my God. And now, ſaith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his ſervant, to bring Jacob again to him: Though Iſrael be not gathered; yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength. And he ſaid, it is a light thing that thou ſhouldſt be my ſervant to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael; I will alſo give thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my ſalvation unto the end of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth kind of Promiſes made by <hi>Jehovah</hi> unto Chriſt in the Covenant of Redemption, were ſuch as relate to the ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and proſpering of the work of Redemption in his hand And unto this head, I refer, 1. The promiſe of God's making Chriſt the <hi>man of his right hand;</hi> and that not only in reſpect of ſpecial love and honour, but eſpecially in reſpect of inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; whereby God promiſes to make him the main Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58137:63"/>of action, that ſhould be made ſerviceable to his ends in the work of Redemption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.17, <hi>Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the Son of man whom thou madest ſtrong for thy ſelf.</hi> 2. The promiſe of a ſucceſsful iſſue of his undertakings; the Lord covenanteth to Chriſt, and giveth to him aſſurances that he ſhall effect the work which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh; as if <hi>Jehovah</hi> had been Surety for this, he ſtrikes hands with him, that he ſhall go and proſper, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, <hi>The pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.—He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul.—by his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant justifie many.</hi> Iſa. 49.6, 7, 8, <hi>And he ſaid, it is a light thing that thou ſhouldst be my ſervant to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael; I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my ſalvation unto the end of the earth. Thus ſaith the Lord, the Redeemer of Iſrael, and his holy One, to him whom man deſpiſeth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a ſervant of rulers; Kings ſhall ſee and ariſe, Princes alſo ſhall worſhip, becauſe of the Lord that is faithful, and the holy One of Iſrael; and he ſhall chuſe thee. Thus ſaith the Lord, in an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of ſalvation have I helped thee; and I will preſerve thee, and give thee for a Covenant of the people, to eſtabliſh the earth, to cauſe to inherit the deſolate heritages.</hi> 3. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of victory over all his enemies: the Lord covenanteth with Chriſt, that whoſoever maketh oppoſition to him in any of his offices, in any part of his work, of working Redemption and Salvation for his elect people, ſhall be trodden down, and ſhall fall before him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1, 5, 6, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. The Lord at thy right hand ſhall ſtrike through kings in the day of his wrath. He ſhall judg among the heathen; he ſhall fill the places with the dead bodies, he ſhall wound the heads over many countreys.</hi> Pſal. 89.23, <hi>Aed I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.</hi> 4. The promiſes of triumph: God covenanteth with him, not only to give him the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but a moſt glorious publick triumph over Principalities and Powers, and all oppoſitions and enemies to his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12, <hi>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong.</hi> Eph. 4.8, <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, when he aſcended up on high, he led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58137:63"/>captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> Col. 2.15, <hi>And having ſpoiled principalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</hi> It was in the faith of theſe Promiſes made to Chriſt concerning his Father's ſtanding by him in this work, and crowning it with ſucceſs in his hand, that he put on that holy hardneſs againſt all oppoſition, and walked as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned who ſtood in his way, ſince his Father was with him, engaged by ſo ſolemn an act of promiſe and covenant made with him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.6, 7, 8, 9, <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting. For the Lord God will help me; therefore ſhall I not be confounded; therefore have I ſet my face like a flint, and I know that I ſhall not be aſhamed. He is neer that justifieth me, who will contend with me? let us stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who is mine adverſary? let him come neer to me. Behold, the Lord God will help me, who is he that ſhall condemn me? lo, they all ſhall wax old as a garment, the moth ſhall eat them up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth kind of Promiſes made by <hi>Jehovah</hi> to Chriſt in the Covenant of Redemption, were thoſe that relate unto his Fathers acceptance of the travel of his Soul in this work of our Redemption. And under this I comprehend, 1. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was ſpoken to him of his Father's delectation, and taking pleaſure in the perſon of Chriſt God-man, and in his Mediatory-tranſactions; all delight ariſeth from ſutableneſs, and this from Chriſt's ſutableneſs unto the Lords ends, and the ſervice unto which he was choſen, and his ſutable actings unto theſe ends, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.21, 22, <hi>Now when all the people were baptized, it came to paſt that Jeſus alſo being baptized, and praying, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was opened: And the Holy Ghoſt deſcended in a bodily ſhape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which ſaid, then art my beloved Son, in thee I am well-pleaſed.</hi> Prov. 8.30, <hi>Then I was by him as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoycing always before him.</hi> Iſa. 42.1, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mune elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth.</hi> 2. The promiſe of gracious acceptance to whatſoever he ſhould act or requeſt, on the behalf of his Redeemed ones, within the time of Grace. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, in an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of ſalvation have I helped thee.</hi> Joh. 11.41, 42, <hi>Father I thank thee that thou haſt heard me: And I knew that thou heareſt me always.</hi> Heb. 5.7, <hi>Who
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58137:64"/>in the days of his fleſh, when he had offered up Prayers and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, with ſtrong crying and tears, unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard in that he feared.</hi> 3. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Juſtification: there was ſome ſort of Juſtification co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted to him, which he eyeth, and wherewith he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged himſelf under hard and reproachful uſage, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.8, <hi>He is near that iuſtifieth me, who will contend with me?</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it is ſaid of him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, <hi>he was juſtified in the ſpirit;</hi> and though he was not capable of remiſſion of ſin, and juſtification, from intrinſecal guilt; for he had none, being <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, and ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> Heb. 7.26. <hi>becauſe he had done no violence; neither was there any deceit in his mouth,</hi> Iſa. 53.7. Yet juſtification is promiſed to him, and he is ſaid to be juſtified, 1. Becauſe he was a perfect doer and obeyer of the Law, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7, <hi>But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> Chriſt did in all things give conſummate and perfect obedience to the Law: and this is to be juſtified by a Law-juſtification and title to life, which <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have had; if he had obeyed the Law and Covenant of works. 2. When his cauſe is juſtified, he himſelf is formally juſtified, in reſpect of theſe ſins for which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſatisfie: the cauſe that he ſtood for in the Covenant of Redemption, the action is win in Law that he ſtood for, and that was his elect peoples cauſe, for whom he ſtood when Juſtice ſmote him; he is juſtified and acquitted from our ſins, though he had none of his own, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9, <hi>knowing that Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</hi> 3. He is juſtified as a publick perſon (though in no private capacity) as head of the party whom he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and whoſe Law place he took upon him, as one who perſonated and acted the part of another by allowance and warrant of Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10.13, <hi>For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many Sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings.—And again, I will put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y truſt in him; and again, Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me.</hi> 4. He is juſtified declaratively, in regard that he was declared by a Law, act and Judicial-declaration, to he <hi>Jeſus the righteous,</hi> 1. Joh. 2.1. who had fatisfied the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4, <hi>And declared to be the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58137:64"/>Son of God with power, according to the ſpirit of holineſs, by the reſurrection from the dead;</hi> he was declared juſtified by his reſurrection, even as he was declared condemned by his death. 5. He is juſtified by cancelling his bond of Suretiſhip which he gave to <hi>Jehovah;</hi> and now having compleatly ſatisfied for our debts, which was the intent of that bond of Suretiſhip, the right is cancelled, according to the manner of the Creditor's delivering back the bond to the Debtor when it is ſatisfied: And thus we are to conceive, when he <hi>blotted out the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of ordinances that was againſt us,</hi> Col. 2.14. that he had then a diſcharge of his bond of Suretiſhip for our debt; for his bond could not lye for our debt, when ours was cancelled And though the preciſe ſcope of that Scripture and Context lead us to underſtand the cancelling there mentioned, as firſtly relative to the Ceremonial-Law; yet I know no reaſon why we ſhould reſtrict it to that only; but, we may extend it to the ſins againſt, and threatnings of the Moral Law alſo, in ſo far as that is a writing againſt us, eſpecially ſince the words immediately before, ſpeak of Juſtification and remiſſion of all ſins, as a fruit of Chriſt's death; and the words following, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the extent of his death in this glorious conqueſt and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over all his peoples enemies. 6. He is juſtified, becauſe it is acted and recorded in the volume of the book of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, that he hath fulfilled what was written of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in the book of God's eternal Decrees; and in this ſenſe a perſon may be ſaid to be juſtified, who being acted in the record of a book to perform any thing, or to pay any debt, or to become baile for any perſon, when it is thereafter alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of him, that he ſatisfied and performed his undertaking. And thus we find that his undertaking and ſuretiſhip that was recorded ere he came into the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou didſt not deſire, mine ears haſt thou opened, burnt offering and ſin offering haſt thou not required,</hi> &amp;c. Is alſo recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him to have been ſatisfied by him, when he came into the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7, <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith, ſacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not; but a body haſt thou prepared me. In burnt offerings and ſacrifices for ſin thou haſt had no pleaſure. Then ſaid I, to I come, in the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God.</hi> 7. He is juſtified, becauſe he is openly relaxed and diſmiſſed the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58137:65"/>Priſon, after that he had entered his perſon for payment of the broken man's debt: the Debtor being under laſh and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Law at the Creditor's purſuit, and let go again, is juſtified and acquitted. And thus was Chriſt judicially and by authority of God looſed from death, from the Priſon and Fetters; becauſe the Priſon could not hold him, nor the gripes and fetters of death detain him Priſoner, when the Sentence of the Law was ſatisfied, and the Judg declared him free, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.24, <hi>Whom God hath raiſed up, having looſed the pains of death, becauſe it was not poſſible that he ſhould be holden of it;</hi> 'tis a Phraſe like to that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.20, <hi>The king ſent and looſed him, even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</hi> Rom. 6.9, <hi>Knowing that Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixth kind of Promiſes made by <hi>Jehovah</hi> unto Chriſt, were theſe that relate to the reward that ſhould be given to him for this great work and ſervice in our Redemption: And ſuch were, 1. The promiſe of exaltation, after the debaſement and ignominy that he ſhould humble himſelf unto, in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Suretiſhip; <hi>Jehovah</hi> covenanteth with him to advance him to the greateſt height of dignity and honour that is in earth or heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.27, <hi>Alſo I will make him my firſt born, higher than the kings of the earth.</hi> And 110.7, <hi>He ſhall drink of the brook in the way; therefore ſhall he lift up the head.</hi> Iſa. 53.12, <hi>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtoong;</hi> which was performed unto him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, <hi>And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs; therefore God hath highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 1.3, <hi>When he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſate down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high:</hi> Which promiſes and performances have a peculiar reſpect to the exaltation of Chriſt in his reſurrection from the dead, aſcenſion unto heaven, and ſeſſion at the right hand of God; whereof read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8, 9, 10, 11, compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.25, to 32. And 13.32, 33. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 1. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.34, 35. 2. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſatisfaction, a reward that ſhould ſatisfie him, a reward that ſhould be according to his own heart, and at his own ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and craving, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, <hi>He ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> Pſal. 2.8, <hi>Ask of me, and I ſhall give.</hi> 3. The promiſe of a ſeed: Since a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58137:65"/>redeemed ſeed was one of Chriſt's ends for which he ſerved; he endured hard labour, he ſuffered, he died: which, next unto the honour of God, was upon his heart. The Lord by Covenant with him, promiſeth that he ſhall not want off-ſpring, he ſhall neither want children nor heirs, he ſhall have the ſatisfaction which he deſired, <hi>Iſa</hi> 53.10, 11, <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed.—He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> Heb. 2.13, <hi>Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me.</hi> Eph. 5.25, 26, 27, <hi>Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word: That he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh;</hi> and if this was one of Chriſt's ends for which he wrought, and a part of his reward which his Father promiſed to him; then, 1. Sure he is Lord and Maſter of the will of man, and hath a forcible ſoveraignty and dominion over man's free well,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Rutherf.</hi> Treat. of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>p. 2. c. 9. p. 327, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> to bow and determine it (which <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> deny), elſe how can he promiſe a ſeed to Chriſt, and undeclinably and inſuperably make that promiſe good, and cauſe them believe and perſevere unto the end, whereby they come and abide his ſeed? Then, 2. There is no more deſirable ſight to the eye of Chriſt, than to ſee all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ſeed about him in his Father's houſe, fairly landed, and without the reach of all poſſible danger of periſhing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi> Heb. 2.13, <hi>Behold, I, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which God hath given me.</hi> Then, 3. There can be nothing more certain than the faith, perſeverance and ſalvation of Chriſt's elect and redeemed ſeed; in regard it is both under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by Chriſt in his part of the Covenant of Suretiſhip, and promiſed to Chriſt by his Father; and ſo undertaken by <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> alſo, in the articles of the Covenant of Redemption. 4. The promiſe of a large Dominion and Kingdom: the Lord promiſeth to Chriſt, that a large and flouriſhing Kingdom ſhall be given him, over many countreys, and that he ſhall have many ſubjects, and theſe conquering too, who ſhall ſtand laſt in the fields, and have a proſperous war until the day of their Redemption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8, <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58137:66"/>then for thy inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> And 72.8, 9, 11, <hi>He ſhall have dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. They that dwell in the wilderneſs ſhall bow before him, and his enemies ſhall lick the duſt; yea, all Kings ſhall fall down before him, all Nations ſhall ſerve him.</hi> And 110.3, <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holineſs, from the womb of the morning.</hi> Mal. 1.11, <hi>For from the riſing of the Sun, even unto the going down of the ſame, my name ſhall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incenſe ſhall be burned unto my name, and a pure offering; for my name ſhall be great among the heathen, ſaith the Lord of hoſts</hi> Zech. 9.10, <hi>His dominion ſhall be from ſea to ſea, and from the river, even to the ends of the earth.</hi> Dan. 7.14, <hi>And there was given him dominion and glory, and a Kingdom that all People, Nations and Languages ſhould ſerve him; his dominion is an everlaſting dominion, which ſhall not paſs away, and his Kingdom that which ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi> 5. The promiſe of glory, a peculiar glory in heaven, throughout eternity to the Lord Mediator and Redeemer, to the Lamb that was ſlain, who wrought this great and glorious work of our Redemption; this glory he craveth as his wages, Joh. 17.4, 5, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do: And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf.</hi> This glory he eyed when he was at hard labour about the work, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4, 5, <hi>Surely my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is with the Lord, and my work with my God.—Though Iſrael be not gathered; yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength.</hi> Heb. 12.2, <hi>Who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs.</hi> This glory was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13, <hi>He ſhall build the temple of the Lord, and he ſhall bear the glory.</hi> Iſa. 22.24, <hi>And they ſhall hang upon him all the glory of his Father's houſe;</hi> this glory is actually payed to him in heaven, where the Lamb has a throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3, <hi>But the throne of God, and of the Lamb ſhall be in it.</hi> And 7.17, <hi>For the Lamb which is in the midſt of the throne, ſhall feed them;</hi> where there is a new Song ſung unto the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10, <hi>And they ſung a new Song, ſaying, thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof; for thou waſt ſlain and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58137:66"/>and nation: And haſt made us unto our God Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign on the earth.</hi> Yea, and a crown and glory for his redeemed ſeed, was part of the reward promiſed to him, and for which he wrought, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> Luk. 12.32, <hi>Fear not little flock; for it is your Father's good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> 2 Pet. 5.4, <hi>And when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a crown of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeventh kind of Promiſes made by <hi>Jehovah</hi> to Chriſt, were theſe that relate to intereſt; I mean, the new contracted intereſts, Covenant-intereſts that were promiſed to him, as part of this agreement betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt Mediator, out of which did ſpring all the new Covenant-intereſts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that we have to God: And ſuch were, 1. The intereſt in God as his God by Covenant; for to him was the great Mother promiſe of the Covenant made, <hi>I will be his God,</hi> Pſal. 80.26, <hi>He ſhall cry to me, thou art—my God.</hi> This intereſt is bound up with him in the Covenant of Suretiſhip. 2. The intereſt in God as his Father by Covenant, to Chriſt was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and with him was bound up a new Sonſhip and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-title to God as his Covenanted Father, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.26, <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, thou art my Father.</hi> Heb. 1.5, <hi>I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son;</hi> and theſe Covenant-relations and intereſts, and the compellations ariſing from them, we find Chriſt own and acknowledg, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.17, <hi>I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and to your God.</hi> Hence he calleth us brethren, children of the ſame Father; who have one Covenant-relation with him, to the ſame God, <hi>Hell.</hi> 2.12, <hi>I will declare thy name unto my brethren;</hi> hence God is called <hi>the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. The intereſt of Saviourſhip, for to the man Chriſt 'tis promiſſed that <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſhall be the rock of his Salvation; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.26. he ſhall cry to me, <hi>Thou art my God, and the rock of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> hence he cryed, <hi>Father ſave me from this hour,</hi> Joh. 12.27, <hi>Jehovah</hi> was a Saviour to the man Chriſt from the things that he ſuffered as our ſurety; he ſaveth the head and body: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7, that he cryed <hi>to him that was able to ſave him from death.</hi> 4. The intereſt of headſhip: when Chriſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58137:67"/>was given to be head of his body the Church, he took upon him the man Chriſt, the Mediator took upon him a new relation to God as his head, which is founded and bound up in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Suretiſhip; by which this comely order was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, that Chriſt ſhould be a head to his Church, and God ſhould be a head to the man Chriſt: In this reſpect it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt is God's,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.23, and how? As <hi>ye are Christs,</hi> and <hi>all things are yours;</hi> that is, in a ſubordination to do ſervice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3, and <hi>the head of Chriſt is God;</hi> the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt muſt be the head of Chriſt; a head by union, to which Chriſt is united by bonds of union, not natural only, but foederal, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30, <hi>I, and my father are one. Joh.</hi> 1.1, <hi>And the word was with God;</hi> a head by <hi>influence</hi> of Spirit and Grace to the man Chriſt, who liveth by the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.57, <hi>As the living father hath ſent me, and I live by the father;</hi> a head by way of <hi>order,</hi> who is over Chriſt Mediator, and to whom the man Chriſt is ſubject, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28, <hi>Then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject to him that put all things under him.</hi> 5. The intereſt of hearing Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.26, <hi>He ſhall cry unto me;</hi> this is bound up among the Covenant-intereſts, which he took upon him by his Suretiſhip, and by this relation: when Chriſt ſhould humble himſelf to pray, <hi>Jehovah</hi> promiſeth to hear him, and he hath hearing by Covenant, as his ſeed alſo have it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8, <hi>In an acceptable time have I heard thee.</hi> Joh. 11.41, 42, <hi>Father, I thank thee that thou haſt heard me: And I knew that thou heareſt me always.</hi> Heb. 5.7, <hi>Who in the days of his fleſh, when he had offered up Prayers and Supplications with ſtrong crying and tears unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard in that he feared.</hi> Theſe and the like inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and relations were covenanted to Chriſt; and out of theſe Covenant-intereſts engaged unto him, did our Covenant-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſpring.</p>
               <p>The laſt kind of Promiſes made by <hi>Jehovah</hi> to Chriſt, were theſe which relate to the whole deſign and intent of his Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: And the great and publick effects which it ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the whole frame of the creation, for the elect redeemed peoples ſake. And ſuch were, 1. The promiſe of delivery of the whole creation from bondage and vanity, unto which it was made ſubject for man's Sin, and whereof the whole world
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58137:67"/>is ſick, like a woman travelling in birth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20, 21, 22, <hi>For the creature was made ſubject unto vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him that hath ſubjected the ſame in hope: Becauſe the creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God: For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travelleth in pain toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther until now.</hi> 2. The promiſe of reſtoring all things to their primitive perfection: all things were broken, defaced and marred by man's ſin; inſomuch that the beauty of them all is gone, and nothing remains upon theſe inferiour creatures, but the old ruines of glory; but there ſhall come <hi>a time of the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all things,</hi> Act. 3.21. and who ſhall do this? Chriſt mends and makes all things new again by his Surety-covenant, that were broken by the rupture of the Covenant of works, Rev. 21.15, <hi>And I ſaw a new heaven, and a new earth; for the firſt heaven, and the firſt earth were paſſed away, and there was no more ſea. And he that ſate upon the throne, ſaid, behold, I make all things new.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.13, <hi>Nevertheleſs, we according to his promiſe, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs.</hi> 3. The promiſe of reſtoring the broken league that was betwixt man and the reſt of the creatures in their original condition, when all obeyed <hi>Adam,</hi> and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penders upon him; after the violation of which there was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual war and jarring betwixt man and the reſt of the creatures; ſin did make a breach in the whole creation; when man ſinned, all the creatures became enemies to him, and one to another; but now in Chriſt all the creatures are reconciled, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10, <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times he might gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</hi> Hoſ. 2.18, <hi>And in that day will I make a Covenant for them with the beaſt of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the bow, and the ſword, and the battel out of the earth, and I will make them to lye down ſafely.</hi> By Chriſt's Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhip and the Covenant-promiſes through him, the creatures are brought in a new league with man, <hi>Job</hi> 5.23, <hi>For thou ſhalt be in league with the ſtones of the field, and the beasts of the field ſhall be at peace with thee.</hi> Pſal. 121.6, <hi>The Sun ſhall not ſmite thee by day, nor the Moon by night.</hi> 4. The promiſe of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58137:68"/>removing the Law-curſe out of all diſpenſations, and writing the Goſpel-bleſſing upon them, that all and every of them may be bleſſings in Chriſt to his Redeemed people: <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.4, 5, <hi>Bleſſed ſhall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattel, and the encreaſe of thy kine; bleſſed ſhall be thy basket, and thy ſtore;</hi> that even the rods and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are curſes of the Law to the wicked, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.15, 16, <hi>But it ſhall come to paſs, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to obſerve to do all his commandments and ſtatutes which I command thee this day, that all theſe curſes ſhall come upon thee and overtake thee. Curſed ſhalt thou be in the city, and curſed ſhalt thou be in the field,</hi> &amp;c.) ſhould be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted-mercies, and written in the book of the Covenant of Grace to God's elect people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 33, <hi>If his children forſake my Law, and walk not in my judgments; If they break my ſtatutes, and keep not my commandments, then will I viſit their iniquity with the rod.—Nevertheleſs, my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> Heb. 12.6, <hi>For whom the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> 5. The promiſe of eſtabliſhing and ſetling all things that were ſet a reeling by the breach of the Covenant of works: it is promiſed that Chriſt ſhall be the repairer; it is he that eſtabliſhes the earth, ſo that the creatures that are for man's uſe, are not deſtroved; for Juſtice did require as ſpeedy vengeance upon men, as it did upon the Angels; and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence had been executed immediately, had not the Covenant of Suretiſhip prevented it; and in this reſpect the very reprobate have ſome temporal advantage by way of Concomitancy, and for the elects ſake, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, in an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table time have I heard thee, and in a day of Salvation have I helped thee.</hi> Col. 1.17, <hi>And by him all things conſist.</hi> Heb. 1.3, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholding all things by the word of his power.</hi> All theſe, and promiſes of like nature, were made to Chriſt the firſt heir, whom God <hi>appointed heir of all things,</hi> Heb. 1.2. and for his ſake they redounded unto them. <hi>who ſhall be heirs of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1.14. and it is upon this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the whole Creation are commanded to ſing, becauſe Chriſt the reſtorer of all things, is come to the throne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.11, 12, 13, <hi>Let the heavens rejoyce, and let
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58137:68"/>the earth be glad: let the ſea roar and the fulneſs thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then ſhall all the trees of the wood rejoyce before the Lord, for he cometh; for he cometh to judg the earth; he ſhall judg the world with righteouſneſs, and the people with his truth.</hi> And 98.7, 8, 9, <hi>Let the ſea roar, and the fulneſs thereof: the world, and they that dwell therein. Let the floods clap their hands, let the hills be joyful together before the Lord, for he cometh to judg tht earth; with righteouſneſs ſhall he judg the world, and the people with equity.</hi> 6. The promiſe of the reſpecitive eminent change of the Government from the ſole eſſential Government of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to the diſpenſatory Government of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, <hi>For the Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.25, <hi>For he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet;</hi> for ſuppoſing that the Covenant of works ſhall be broken, the world cannot now any more be ruled according to the rules of that Covenant, to wit, by God the Father imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; for then he muſt deſtroy man: therefore toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the change of the Covenant, there muſt needs be a change of the Government; Chriſt as Mediator muſt govern the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, <hi>The government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder:</hi> and he muſt judg the world in our nature, Act. 17.31, <hi>The man whom God hath appointed:</hi> and he reigns not only over the Church; but alſo (though in a far different way) over all the Kingdoms of the world, and all things in the world, for the Churches ſake, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21, 22, <hi>Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come. And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church.</hi> Heb. 2.5.—7.8, <hi>For unto the Angels hath he not put in ſubjection the world to come, whereof we ſpeak—Thou madest him a little lower than the Angels; and thou crownedſt him with glory and honour, and didst ſet him over the works of thy hands. Thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under his feet; for in that he put all in ſubjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him: But now we ſee not yet all things
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58137:69"/>put under him.</hi> 7. The promiſes of the ſervice of all the world, and of all the creatures; God promiſeth, and will have the ſervices of all the creatures brought about; firſt, to Chriſt, and then to him by Chriſt; he hath the ſervice of all the world promiſed him, and indeed he payed for it; for he bought it with a price; the ſervice of ſome as Sons to live with him, and enjoy him for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3, <hi>Thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from the womb of the morning;</hi> and the ſervice of others as ſlaves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9, <hi>Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel.</hi> And 72.9, 11, <hi>They that dwell in the wilderneſs ſhall bow before him, and his enemies ſhall lick the duſt; Yea, all kings ſhall fall before him, and all nations ſhall ſerve him.</hi> The whole veſſels of this great houſe, the world; whether they are veſſels of honour or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Men or Angels, elect Men or Reprobate, elect Angels or Devils; yet all muſt be for the Maſter's uſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20, <hi>But in a great houſe there are not only veſſels of gold and of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but alſo of wood and of earth; and ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour.</hi> Prov. 16.4, <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf; yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Harmony of the Covenant of Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip made with Chriſt, and the Covenant of Reconciliation and Grace made with Sinners. <hi>1.</hi> Wherein they agree. <hi>2.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ. <hi>3.</hi> What Conjunction and Connexion is betwixt theſe Covenants.</head>
               <p>THere is a great affinity between the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made with Chriſt, and the Covenant of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made with Sinners; but it is not the ſame Covenant that is made with Chriſt, which is made with us: We are therefore to take heed to two extreams, That we neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, nor divide theſe two Covenants. There is a likeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, but not a ſameneſs; there is an union here, but not an evenneſs; there is here a diſtinction, but not a diviſion; a conjunction, but not a confuſion: Let us therefore look upon theſe two Covenants, 1. As agreeing in many things, yet not being the ſame, but ſtill to be diſtinguiſhed. 2. Differing in many things; yet not to be divided nor ſeparated. 3. Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and conjoyned many ways; yet not to be confounded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Covenants of Redemption and Reconciliation, agree together (beſide theſe things that are eſſential, and ſo common to all Covenants, which I do not here mention); in the firſt riſe of both, pure, ſoveraign, free Grace was the fountain of both; hence did both theſe Covenants ſpring: There was no cauſe, reaſon, motive, nor allurement from without, nor any neceſſity of nature within, that made <hi>Jehovah</hi> upon the one part, nor Chriſt upon the other, enter into this agreement of Suretiſhip; it was his meer good and gracious pleaſure, as is already proved; See <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.9, <hi>Having made known unto us the myſterie of his will, according to his good pleaſure, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in himſelf.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9, <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling; not according to our works, but according to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58137:70"/>his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.</hi> And the ſame is the fountain-cauſe, the firſt ſpring and riſe of God's Covenant of Reconciliation with us; it is not from any reaſon, cauſe or motive in us, nor from any neceſſity upon God; but meerly his gracious pleaſure, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7, <hi>In whom we have Redemption through his blood, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, according to the riches of his grace.</hi> Deut. 7.7, 8, <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor chuſe you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye were more in number than any people: But becauſe the Lord loved you, and becauſe he would keep the oath which he had ſworn unto your fathers.</hi> Mat. 11.25, <hi>I thank thee, O father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes; even ſo father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe two Covenants agree in this; That it is the ſame <hi>deſign</hi> and buſineſs that is carried on in both: The Redemption of a loſt or lapſed elect people, or as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10, <hi>The bringing many ſons to glory:</hi> This was the buſineſs that Chriſt did undertake by the Covenant of Suretiſhip, and which he doth proſecute and perfect by the Covenant of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This was the thing that was treated and agreed betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, and is now over again treated and agreed betwixt Chriſt and us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2, <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye promiſed before the world began.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19, <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them; and hath committed to us the word of Reconciliation.</hi> Joh. 17.4, <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe two Covenants agree in this, That the <hi>grand Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality</hi> of doing the work in both theſe Covenants, is upon Chriſt; he was to be the main Inſtrument of action in the work of theſe two Covenants, and is therefore (as for other reaſons, ſo alſo upon this account) called <hi>the man of God's right hand,</hi> Pſal. 80.17. whoſe inſtrumentality and ſervice God did uſe, from beginning to end, in all this buſineſs, both of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reconciliation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7, <hi>In whom we have redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through his blood.</hi> Col. 1.20, <hi>And having made peace through the blood of his croſs, by him to reconcile all things to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:58137:70"/>4. They agree in this, that both theſe Covenants <hi>are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable with Gods election</hi> of the parties with whom he made the Covenants: He firſt chuſed Chriſt, and by an eternal deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, elected him to be the only perſon that ſhould work the great work of Redemption, and be the Captain of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his people; and with him only he makes the Covenant of Redemption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19, <hi>I have exalted one choſen out of the people.</hi> Again, he makes choice of an elect Company to follow this Captain, to be a <hi>people ſaved by the Lord,</hi> and with this elect company only, <hi>choſen in Chriſt,</hi> he makes a Covenant of peace and reconciliation in him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.68, 69, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for he hath viſited and redeemed his people: And hath raiſed up an horn of Salvation for us in the houſe of his ſervant David.</hi> In both (I ſay) the Covenant is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to God's election; the parties with whom God made both theſe Covenants, were firſt choſen; he firſt chuſeth, and then covenanteth with the elect head, and with the elect body and members, and with them only; See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.3, <hi>I have made a Covenant with my choſen.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.13, <hi>God hath from the beginning choſen you to Salvation, through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe Covenants of Redemption and Reconciliation agree in this, that the <hi>principal ends</hi> of both, are the ſame; which were, 1. The higheſt manifeſtation of all the Lords glorious attributes, which were ſo manifeſted in Chriſt, as they were never known before (whereof in its proper place); this was one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ends which the Lord had before him, both in the Covenant of Redemption, and the Covenant of Reconciliation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11, <hi>And to make all men ſee what is the fellowſhip of the Myſtery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt. To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the Church, the manifold wiſdom of God, according to the eternal purpoſe, which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> 2. The higheſt and neareſt union of man with God, was one of the Lords ends in both theſe Covenants, to make up ſuch an union betwixt God and Man, as might be a ground and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſutable communion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.20, <hi>At that day ye ſhall know that I am in my father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17, <hi>But he that is joyned to the Lord, is one ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:58137:71"/>3. Another principal end which God had before him in his Covenant-dealings, was the higheſt and fulleſt communication of himſelf to man; this end was propoſed in both theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of Redemption and Reconciliation; God would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe nothing of himſelf unto the creatures, but by his Son; and through his Covenant with him, and with us, he purpoſed to communicate himſelf to us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11, <hi>And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</hi> And 1.3, <hi>And truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Covenant of Suretiſhip made with Chriſt, and the Covenant of Redemption and Grace made with ſinners, agree in this, That the <hi>good</hi> and advantage of both theſe Covenants redounded unto us, even as the honour of both accrues unto the Lord, who after the opening of this ſubject of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-dealings with Chriſt, and through him with us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, to 8, immediately ſubjoyns, <hi>I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory I will not give to another;</hi> both theſe Covenants were tranſacted <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> Eph. 1.6. But the profit and advantage of both is ours, not his; and if theſe words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2, 3, <hi>My goodneſs extendeth not unto thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight,</hi> be the words of Chriſt (or relating to Covenant-tranſactions betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt), as moſt part of that Pſalm is,<note place="margin">J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, <hi>The grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.15, <hi>For all things are for your ſakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many, redound to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. They agree in this, That there is <hi>exchange of places</hi> betwixt Chriſt and his elect redeemed ſeed, in both theſe Covenants. In the Covenant of Suretiſhip he taketh our Law-place and room, and putteth himſelf in the ſinners ſtead (as hath been ſaid), <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, <hi>Lo, I come, to do thy will.</hi> And again, in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Reconciliation, we take Chriſt's Law-place, or rather have beſtowed upon us that place and room with God, which the Law allowed to him that obeyeth the Law, and ſatisfieth
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58137:71"/>the Law to the full: Hence 'tis ſaid, that we are <hi>made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. This is our place by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Reconciliation, to have that high righteouſneſs of our Surety, unto which the God-head gave excellency, and <hi>the righteouſneſs of the Law</hi> (is ſaid) <hi>to be fulfilled in us,</hi> Rom. 8.4. to wit, the paſſive righteouſneſs thereof, in ſuffering for the breach of the Law: and how was this? only by commutation and exchange of places with Chriſt our Surety, who put himſelf in our place, and put us in his.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Covenant of Redemption, and the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, agree in many properties; both theſe Covenants are free, gracious, everlaſting, ordered in all things, ſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as may fully appear by what is already ſpoken of the properties of the Covenant of Suretiſhip, and by the ſecond part of this Treatiſe, which relates to the properties of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place let us take notice of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Covenants of Redemption and Reconciliation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may appear that theſe are two Covenants, and not one and the ſame. Theſe Covenants differ,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>riſe:</hi> although they agree thus far in the riſe,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Rutherf.</hi> Treat. of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>p. 2. c. 8.</hi>
                  </note> that both theſe Covenants had the riſe from Grace (as I have ſhewed), yet they differ in this, that the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Suretiſhip did ſpring out of Grace in both the parties; for therein did the Grace of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt appear; it was the gracious pleaſure and good will of both the parties, which equally gave it the firſt riſe. But the Grace that giveth the riſe to the Covenant of Reconciliation, is not ſhared between the parties, but it ſtands all upon one ſide: Grace in God, and in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, without any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſpoſition or qualification upon our part (till it be wrought in us by the Grace of Chriſt) giveth the firſt riſe to the Covenant of Reconciliation and Grace made with ſinners, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared unto all men.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.10, 19, <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God; but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins.—We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> Rom. 5.6, 8, <hi>For when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for us.—But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Christ died for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:58137:72"/>2. Theſe Covenants differ in the <hi>property</hi> of eternity; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both are everlaſting Covenants, yet both are not <hi>eternal:</hi> The Covenant of Redemption is eternal; for the Lord does not begin in time to deſign Chriſt a Surety and Mediator; nor does the Son begin in time to be a Conſenter; but we are to underſtand the Apoſtles ſaying, <hi>he was made ſurety,</hi> Heb. 7.22. by Chriſt's own ſaying, <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, <hi>Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world; but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times for you.</hi> But the Covenant of Reconciliation is no more eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, than all other things which come to paſs in time, which were from eternity decreed with God, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.18, <hi>Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the world;</hi> for although the Covenant of Reconciliation was decreed from everlaſting; yet it had no being as a Covenant, nor could have any, till firſt there were objects created to deal with in the way and terms of a Covenant; till firſt the Covenant of works were entered with man, and broken too; till firſt man by his breach of the firſt Covenant, and his fall into ſin and enmity with God, became a qualified object for reconciliation, and the Grace that is peculiar to this Covenant: Then came the news and knowledg of a Redeemer to <hi>Adam,</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his fall (for the Grace and love of Chriſt which longed for this opportunity, to be made manifeſt, made haſte, when man was now a qualified object); then tidings came in all haſte to loſt man, of a Saviour, when he was lying ſick unto death of his fall, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2, 3, <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye, promiſed before the world began: But hath in due time mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his word through preaching;</hi> then came <hi>the ranſom to be teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in due time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Parties</hi> are different. In the Covenant of Suretiſhip and Redemption, the Parties are <hi>Jehovah</hi> and his only Son Chriſt (as is before proved); but in the Covenant of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, the Parties are God the Father, Son and Spirit, and loſt Sinners, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them.</hi> The one is ſtricken betwixt God and Chriſt <hi>God-man,</hi> a perſon that is not meer man, conſidered in the preciſe notion of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, as betwixt God and meer men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58137:72"/>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The one is a Covenant betwixt God and his <hi>only begotten</hi> natural <hi>Son,</hi> Heb. 5.5; the other is betwixt God and <hi>many Sons,</hi> even his adopted Sons, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. the Covenant of Redemption is made with <hi>Chriſt perſonal</hi> (as hath been proved); the Covenant of Grace (as it comprehends the whole buſineſs of Grace, from beginning to end) with <hi>Chriſt myſtical,</hi> head and body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. with him and the children whom God hath given to him; the Covenant of Suretiſhip is made with Chriſt as a <hi>peculiar choſen perſon,</hi> Pſal. 89.19, <hi>I have exalted one choſen out of the people;</hi> who did by that Covenant take upon him a publick capacity, wherein he did ever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after act, in heaven and earth; but the Covenant of Grace is made with Chriſt as a <hi>publick perſon,</hi> repreſenting many with Chriſt, as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who ſtood and covenanted for all his ſeed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13, <hi>Behold, I, and the children which God hath given me.</hi> Rom. 5.19, <hi>For as by one mans diſobedience, many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> Gal. 3.16, <hi>Now to Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made: he ſaith not, and to ſeeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy ſeed which is Chriſt.</hi> The Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was betwixt God, and <hi>the man who is his fellow,</hi> Zech. 13.7. the Covenant of Reconciliation is betwixt God and Men, who are the work of his hands; not his equals, but his ſubjects, his ſervants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe of the loweſt rank and degree, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.6, 7, <hi>What is man, that thou art mindful of him, or the Son of man, that thou viſiteſt him: Thou madeſt him a little lower than the Angels.</hi> The Covenant of Redemption is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and his Son in favour and friendſhip with him, who never offended him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> but the Covenant of Reconciliation is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and his enemies, ſinners at variance and enmity with God; and it's made with Chriſt, only as he took the ſinners place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8.10, <hi>But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us;—for when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Covenant of Redemption, is an equal Covenant; but the Covenant of Reconciliation is unequal: This difference is in the <hi>Nature</hi> of theſe Covenants. I ſay, the Covenant of Redemption is an equal Covenant, being betwixt equal parties, and upon equal terms and conditions (as I have already ſhewed):
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58137:73"/>But the Covenant of Reconciliation made with ſinners, is an unequal covenant, where there is, 1. Infinite unequality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the parties, betwixt Man and his Maker; God who worketh, <hi>and who ſhall let it?</hi> Iſa. 43.13. and man, who <hi>layd in the ballance, is altogether lighter then vanity,</hi> Pſal. 62.9. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God who giveth conditions to his creatures, but taketh none from them; and man, who giveth no conditions to God, but is bound to accept what conditions he is pleaſed to give. 2. There is a vaſt diſproportion and unequality in the terms and conditions of this Covenant, betwixt that which is promiſed upon God's part, and that which is required upon man's part; betwixt the condition of the Covenant of Reconciliation, and the promiſes and bleſſings thereof: O what vaſt unequality and diſproportion betwixt our <hi>little faith,</hi> and of low ſtature; and the <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory</hi> that is promiſed to the believer! 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There was no <hi>Mediator</hi> in the Covenant of Redemption, neither was there need of any; the parties covenanting being ſo near to one another, and in ſo good terms, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30, <hi>Then was I by him, as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoycing always before him.</hi> Neither could there be any Mediator in this Covenant; for who could interpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father and the Son? <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30, <hi>I, and my Father are one;</hi> and from whence ſhould the Mediator be taken when that eternal tranſaction was made when Chriſt was <hi>ſet up from everlaſting, before his works of old? Prov.</hi> 8.22, 23. But in the Covenant of Reconciliation, there is a Mediator (the need whereof, we ſhall ſhew in its proper place); there is a <hi>days-man,</hi> a perſon who interpoſeth betwixt the parties who are at variance, and travelleth in the peace, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Heb. 12.24, <hi>And to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Promiſes</hi> of theſe two Covenants are different: 1. There be many promiſes in the Covenant of Reconciliation made to us, that cannot agree to Chriſt, and whereof he was not capable; ſuch as the promiſes of a new heart, of cleanſing from all filthineſs and Idols; the promiſes of repentance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and the like, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 2. There were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to Chriſt in the Covenant of Redemption, that were
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58137:73"/>peculiar to himſelf, that were peculiar for the preheminency of the Head and Captain of our Salvation, and whereof we are not capable, ſuch as a throne at the right hand of God, a name above every name, Dominion from Sea to Sea, all power in Heaven and Earth, and the like, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8, 13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.22.25, 27. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There be many <hi>threatnings</hi> annexed to the Covenant of Reconciliation: Threatnings of Goſpel-vengeance to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation; which at firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him?</hi> 1 Cor. 16.22, <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</hi> But there are no threatnings in the Covenant of Suretiſhip, nothing denounced againſt the man Chriſt if he ſhould fail of his undertakings; for there was no uſe nor place for threatnings in that Covenant, in regard the undertaker was exempted from all poſſible failing in the performance, the man Chriſt could not poſſibly ſin, nor fall ſhort of that Covenant, in regard of the perſonal union.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Commands</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Covenant of Reconciliation are different: For, 1. There are commands in the Covenant of Redemption peculiar to Chriſt alone, and ſuch as are not required of us, nor do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to us; ſuch as the command of taking upon him our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and laying down his life, and making his ſoul an offering for Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heb. 10.5, 7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11. Again, there are commands and conditions required in the Covenant of Reconciliation, which are peculiar to us alone; ſuch as the commands of believing in Chriſt, repenting and working out our Salvation with fear and trembling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Act. 16.31. and 3.19. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. The former is Chriſt's work, not ours; and theſe are conditions required of us, not of Chriſt. 2. All the commands of the Covenant of Redemption are conditions: whatſoever work is put upon Chriſt to do, is a condition of his Covenant with <hi>Jehovah;</hi> but all the conditions of the Covenant of Reconciliation, are not conditions of the righteouſneſs and life therein promiſed; elſe Juſtification ſhould be of works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4, 5, <hi>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt: But to him that worketh not, but believeth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58137:74"/>on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Phil. 3.7, <hi>But what things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Christ.</hi> 3. The conditions of the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are works, down-right obedience, doing and ſuffering, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> But the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Reconciliation, is grace, not works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16, <hi>Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed; Not to that only which is of the law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.</hi> 4. The conditions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption, are antecedent meritorious conditions; for which the reward and wages promiſed to Chriſt by that Covenant is given, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, 5, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do. And now, O father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf.</hi> But the conditions of the Covenant of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation are not antecedent conditions, ſuch as are in civil contracts of Juſtice, when one thing is given for another; but they are conſequent conditions, ſuch as hold forth the connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and order of things: Conditions which do not hold forth the cauſe for which God gives the things promiſed, but the connexion of things, the qualification of the ſubject, or the way and means of conveyance, by and through which he gives the things promiſed, and without which he will not give them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25, <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt: Whom God hath ſent forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The Covenant of Redemption tarried not for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to make it an actual Covenant; neither had any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency upon man, or any act of his will; but alone upon the free will and good pleaſure of him who is Lord of our will, and could give us away to Chriſt, without our knowledg and conſent, when yet we were not; becauſe he hath power over the clay, and can indeclinably bow the wills of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: therefore, I ſay, this Covenant tarried not for our ſaying Amen to it; but was actually concluded and tranſacted with Chriſt, who was ſet up from everlaſting in Heaven as deſigned Mediator, before we were in a capacity to know it, or to ſay yea, or no: being a deed that was from everlaſting, as we have often hinted from <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, to 31. But the Covenant
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58137:74"/>of Reconciliation made with us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> depends principally upon Chriſt's eternal tranſactions with <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whereby we were virtually in Covenant with God, through his undertaking for us, to procure our conſent unto ſuch conditions of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and life, as his Father had fore-ordained, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> So alſo it cannot be an actual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Covenant with us, without our own conſent: before we are actually and formally in Covenant with God, through Grace; and before we receive any actual benefit by a new Covenant ſtate; not the Spirit only muſt ſay come; but the Bride alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17, 20, <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come,—Amen, even ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But although theſe Covenants are on this wiſe to be differenced and diſtinguiſhed; yet they are not to be divided and ſeparated: there is an obſervable conjunction and connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the Covenant of Redemption made with Chriſt, and the Covenant of Reconciliation and Grace made with us Sinners; which doth demonſtrate the dependance of this latter upon the former, and that the Covenant of Reconciliation hath its riſe and original from the Covenant of Redemption made betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Covenants are conjoyned together by a five-fold connexion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By an <hi>inſeparable</hi> connexion: There is ſuch a near and ſtrict conjunction betwixt theſe Covenants, that they cannot be ſeparated; take away the Covenant of Suretiſhip, and the Covenant of Grace falls to the ground; this can no more ſtand without that, than a houſe without a foundation; take away the foundation, and the whole building and ſuperſtructure falls. God hath founded the Covenant of Reconciliation made with us, upon the eternal compact of Redemption which he made with Chriſt; his Covenant with Chriſt is the key and corner-ſtone of the whole frame and building of his Covenant with us; yea, it is the very pillars of the houſe that wiſdom hath built; of that Maſter-piece of work that is worthy the wiſdom of him that framed it, and cannot be ſeparated from the Covenant made with us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.1, <hi>Wiſdom hath built her houſe, ſhe hath hewen out her ſeven pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</hi> therefore the Lord gives the Name to Chriſt, <hi>a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58137:75"/>corner-ſtone, a ſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ndation,</hi> Iſa. 28.16. Hence alſo the whole building of Covenant-mercy and faithfulneſs with us, is joyned with God's Covenant with Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.2, 3, <hi>For I have ſaid, Mercy ſhall be built up for ever, thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſhalt thou eſtabliſh in the very heavens: I have made a Covenant with my choſen.</hi> Iſa. 59.21, <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By an <hi>infallible</hi> connexion, whereby one thing doth neceſſarily and certainly follow upon another: for ſuppoſing that God hath made a Covenant of Redemption with Chriſt, and hath from eternity given a people to him, to be redeemed by him; it neceſſarily follows that this redeemed people ſhall come under Covenant-dealings with Chriſt, by faith in him; for if that go before, this muſt needs follow, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me: and him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> And 17.6, 8, <hi>I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me, and they have kept thy word. For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me:</hi> The reaſon is manifeſt; becauſe as nothing is here tranſacted in time, which was not from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity concluded in the counſel of God's Will; ſo nothing is there concluded, nothing agreed betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt that can miſs to take effect, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.18, <hi>Known unto him are all his works, from the beginning of the world.</hi> And 4.27, 28, <hi>For of a truth, againſt thy holy child Jeſus, whom thou haſt anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Iſrael were gathered together, for to do whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel determined before to be done.</hi> And 13.48, <hi>And as many as were ordained to life, believed.</hi> Iſa. 53.10, <hi>And the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe two Covenants are conjoyned by an <hi>Inſuperable</hi> connexion, ſuch as the ſtrength of no oppoſition can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58137:75"/>for the Covenant of Suretiſhip made with Chriſt, hath ſuch ſtrong influence on the Covenant of Reconciliation made with us, that it regardeth no oppoſition in the way of that work: but the people who are given to Chriſt by that firſt Covenant to be redeemed by him, he doth redeem them out of all Nations by the mighty efficacious power and working of his Spirit; he bows their wills indeclinably to believe; <hi>to hearken that their ſouls may live,</hi> and to make with him <hi>an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> Iſa. 55.3. Joh. 17.2, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him;</hi> the force of this Covenant with <hi>Jehovah</hi> draws ſo, that nothing can keep back the Sinner from coming, <hi>Song.</hi> 1.4, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> Matth. 16.18, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> Zech. 10.8, <hi>I will hiſs for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By a <hi>ſecret</hi> and hidden connexion, which natural eyes and carnal minds cannot ſee nor take up: This ſecret and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Covenant was long hid in God's breaſt, even after it had a being betwixt him and Chriſt; yea, and how great a ſecret was it in the world, even after it began to break forth firſt in Paradiſe? <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26, <hi>Even the myſterie which hath been hid from ages, and from generations; but now is made manifeſt to his Saints.</hi> Pſal. 25.14, <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> It is but one continued tract of Covenant-grace, one current of the water of life, that run along like a river under ground, hidden in the ſecret counſel of God's Will, and kept cloſe betwixt God and Chriſt, and at length brake out above ground in a Covenant of peace with believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18, <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe the immutability of his counſel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by an Oath: That by two immutable things, wherein it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have a ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi> Joh. 17.7, <hi>Now they have known that all things whatſoever thou haſt given me, are of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe Covenants are conjoyned by a <hi>beautiful</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, which eminently ſhineth in the exact correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Covenant of Suretiſhip made with Chriſt, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58137:76"/>the Covenant of peace made with us; which being laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, do perfectly quadrate, and anſwer one another in all points. O what a deal of beauty is to be ſeen in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the Covenants of Redemption and Reconciliation! In the former all things relating to the Redemption and Salvation of Chriſt's elect ſeed, were plotted and contrived; in the latter, the ſame things are executed: by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they were ordered, by this they are acted. It is the ſame buſineſs in the hand of Chriſt, by the Covenant of Reconciliation, which was long before in his heart, when he made a Covenant with <hi>Jehovah:</hi> the ſame deſign of love acted him in both. Now Chriſt negotiates the ſame buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which was long before undertaken by his Suretiſhip, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6, 7, 8, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me, and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that all things whatſoever thou haſt given me, are of thee. For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have received them, and known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst ſend me.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19, 21, <hi>God was in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: and hath committed unto us the word of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Zech. 9.11, <hi>As for thee alſo, by the blood of thy Covenant, I have ſent forth thy priſoners out of the pit wherein is no water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, there is ſuch a connexion between the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption made with Chriſt, and the Covenant of Reconciliation made with us, as is betwixt the cauſe and the effect; God's Covenant with Chriſt is the cauſe; his Covenant with us is the effect: for it hath a proper efficiency in the producing of this, ſuch as is betwixt the root and the branch, the fountain and the ſtreams; the Covenant made with us, did ſpring out of that fountain, did grow out of that root; for Covenant-grace is in God's dealings with us, as ſap is in the branch, and water in the ciſtern; but it is in his Covenant-dealings with Chriſt, as ſap is in the root, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the fountain. There is ſuch a connexion betwixt theſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58137:76"/>two Covenants, as betwixt decree and execution, delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and action, promiſe and performance, ſuretiſhip and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, bond and payment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Covenant with Chriſt was in the decree of God; with us, it is the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that eternal decree; there it was deliberated and conſulted, here 'tis acted; there the promiſes were made, the ſuretiſhip acted, the bond given: but in God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-dealings with us, the promiſes made betwixt God and Chriſt are performed, his act of ſuretiſhip ſatisfied, and actual payment and ſatisfaction made of all obligements which he took on.</p>
               <p>The connexion of the Covenants of Redemption and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation may be illuſtrated by a ſimilitude or two. It is as if a deed of favour were drawn for children and heirs not yet born, and the whole conveyance ſetled, how that deed of favour ſhall redound unto the benefit of children not yet born, which in due time by the wiſdom of the contriver takes place and becomes actually profitable to thoſe for whom it was intended. The Covenant of Redemption is the wiſe contrivance of this deed of favour to a ſeed given to Chriſt, but not yet created; and the Covenant of Reconciliation is the conveyance by which the favour intended for this elect people takes place.</p>
               <p>Or, as if a Marriage were concluded by a wiſe father betwixt his only ſon, and a perſon wholly under his power at his diſpoſing; but now under-age, not marriageable, nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to give conſent to ſuch a contract as were drawn up; but the knowledg of this is kept up from the bride a great while, but at laſt the bridegroom makes propoſals accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his fathers concluded contract, and gains the brides heart and conſent to the intended match; this matter is all of a piece, and every part of it connected with another; but the firſt part is the work of the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt: And the latter part is the work of the Covenant of Reconciliation betwixt God and Sinners.</p>
               <p>Or as if a King upon paction with his Son ſhould grant a fair Charter with many priviledges, to perſons who yet know nothing of the King's favour, the actual communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe priviledges being ſuſpended till the King's Son
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58137:77"/>actually own theſe perſons for his Subjects, and they actually own him for their Lord. The Covenant made with Chriſt is the fair Charter: the Covenant made with us is the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual owning betwixt the King's Son, and the perſons to whom the favours and priviledges of the great Charter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was intended.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Grounds of aſſurance and comfort, and ſupports of Faith, reſulting from the Covenant of Suretiſhip, unto all thoſe who are in the Covenant of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and Grace.</head>
               <p>I Shall ſhut up the Doctrine of the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Suretiſhip, with a collection of ſome grounds of comfort, and ſupports of Faith which ariſe from it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the original and foundation of God's Covenant-dealings with us, is an eternal compact betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, and had not its beginning and riſe from our firſt thoughts of that buſineſs, when we begun to entertain the news of a Saviour, and of Redemption by him; it bred not in our breaſts, but was under deliberation betwixt God and Chriſt long before ever it entred into our hearts; yea, it was there tranſacted, <hi>the heirs of Salvation</hi> were fore-ordained unto their lot and inheritance with them who are ſanctified, when <hi>the Captain of Salvation</hi> was deſtinate unto this work, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13, <hi>God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth.</hi> And it is only the manifeſtation of this to us, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it that is of yeſterday, and but lately tranſacted, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8, <hi>For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58137:77"/>ſend me.</hi> Heb. 6.17, 18, <hi>Wherein God, willing more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe the immutability of his will, comfirmed it by an oath: That by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi> O how comfortable and ſtrengthening is this to the weak believer, that eternal Covenant-love, Covenant-dealings, and Covenant-relations and engagements, begin at the head Chriſt, fall firſt upon him, and deſcend to his redeemed ſeed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt; according as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ſame love of the Father and of Chriſt, which now hath appeared and broken forth, in drawing thee into this new Covenant-ſtate, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3, <hi>The Lord hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of old unto me, ſaying, I have loved thee with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love, therefore with loving-kindneſs have I drawn thee;</hi> hath been in action for thee and about thee in eternity, when thou waſt not, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23, 31, <hi>I was ſet up from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.—Rejoycing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> How ſhould that ſupport faith, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and aſſure our hearts, that the love of God and of Chriſt did provide a rich inheritance for us when we were not yet created, and did provide a phyſician before we fell ſick: who had a Redeemer in readineſs, before the fall of Man, which he foreſaw: who provided a Surety before he was needed, to be in readineſs to ſtrike hands for our Debt; that Chriſt ſpoke kindly for us, when we were not preſent: that he took our caſe in hand undeſired: that he undertook for us when we had neither being, nor action, nor vote, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his undertaking.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That our Redemption and Salvation hath ſo very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of our will in it, and ſo much of Gods Will, and that of Grace, ſo much of his gracious Will, or of the <hi>good pleaſure of his Will,</hi> Eph. 1.5. Being now by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Suretiſhip, the will of the Father and of Chriſt, without our knowledg or conſent, or any act of our will, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.3, 9, <hi>And this is the fathers will that hath ſent me, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58137:78"/>of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day.</hi> With 17.24, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi> And there is now no more of our will in all the buſineſs, but ſo much as is captivated, bowed and carried after Gods will, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13, <hi>For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> Pſal. 110.3, <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> And how ſweet and comfortable is it, that Salvation is by the Covenant of Suretiſhip, taken off the mutable will of man, the ſlippery yea and nay of mans free-will, and laid upon <hi>the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his counſel,</hi> Heb. 6.17, and will, <hi>with whom there is no variableneſs!</hi> Rom. 9.15, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion.</hi> Jam. 1.18, <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That by the Covenant of Suretiſhip the fountain and well-ſpring of Life, and Salvation, and of all the influences that muſt needs act us toward it, lay out of our ſelves, and are placed in Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.7, <hi>All my ſprings are in thee.</hi> Col. 3.3, <hi>Your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> The Well-head of Life to <hi>Adam</hi> was in himſelf; and that which was placed in himſelf went dry, he had no other Fountain whence he had aſſurance to draw and fetch any more: but by Chriſts Suretiſhip, the ſpring of Life and Salvation to us is placed in him, which makes it indefectible to us; and O how ſweet is that to the believer, that his Salvation is fountained in Chriſt! thus when his water fails within, he needs do no more but turn the water cock of Faith that is in his own heart, and take in freſh ſupplies from Jeſus, <hi>the reſurrection and the life,</hi> Joh. 11.25. Iſa. 27.3, <hi>Leſt any hurt it, I will keep it night and day: I will water it every moment.</hi> Joh. 4.14, <hi>The water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> Joh. 14.19, <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. By the Covenant of Suretiſhip, our Rights and Charters, I mean the promiſes not of Heaven and Salvation only, but of all our concernments, are in a ſurer hand than our own, and under better keeping: for now by that Covenant they are in Chriſts keeping, to whom the promiſes are made,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58137:78"/>
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, <hi>Now to Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made; he ſaith not, and to ſeeds as of many, but as of one, and to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt.</hi> He is the firſt <hi>heir of all things,</hi> Heb. 1.2. to whom the firſt title and right to the promiſes, which are our Charters, doth belong: they were firſt his, before they were ours: yea, and he was the firſt poſſeſſor too; upon Chriſt did all the acts of Gods Covenant-love to us fall firſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.34, <hi>I give you the ſure mercies of David.</hi> Moſt of the promiſes were made <hi>formally</hi> to Chriſt, even thoſe which directly relate to our Calling, Juſtification, Salvation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11, <hi>And the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied. By his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities.</hi> And theſe that were not made formally to him, ſuch as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of <hi>a new heart, a new ſpirit, remiſſion of ſins;</hi> yet theſe were made to him <hi>eminenter,</hi> they were laid down in him, and conſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his hand: for Chriſt is not only the fountain and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe of all the promiſes, who merited by his Blood, Remiſſion, Righteouſneſs and Life, which the Lord makes ours by free promiſe; but he is alſo the firſt ſubject of the promiſes: Chriſt receiveth all the Covenant-promiſes which are our Rights and Charters, and he keepeth them, and manageth them for our uſe, as may moſt tend to our good: Chriſt is made by his Suretiſhip, that excellent Ark which keepeth the tables of the Covenant, and the book of the Law and Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.26. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.9, How ſweet and ſatisfying is it, that our Rights of Heaven is in ſuch a Charter-cheſt, and in the hands of ſuch a keeper, even under Chriſts cuſtody, who ſhall give a good account to his Father of all that is committed to him? <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12, <hi>Thoſe whom thou gaveſt me I have kept, and none of them is loſt:</hi> and whoſe keeping is in high account with all thoſe who know him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12, <hi>For I know whom I have believed; and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. By the Covenant of Suretiſhip Chriſt and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever are in a manner in one Writ; for notwithſtanding that there be differences between the Covenant made with him, and that which is made with us, (as is before ſhewed):
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58137:79"/>yet it may be ſaid, that Chriſt and the believer are ſome way in one Writ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe theſe two Covenants are all of a piece; they are to be diſtinguiſhed, but not divided: it is the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Grace, the ſame buſineſs of redeeming and ſaving loſt Man, that is carried on in both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Although Chriſt and the believer be not formally, and as parties, in this Writ of Chriſts Sureti-covenant to God; yet they are virtually, and as to their intereſts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. It is Chriſts buſineſs and concernment, and the believers too; even all his eternal concernments that are in that Covenant, and ours, theſe meet together, and are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in one Writ: and thus even among men, a perſon may be ſaid to be in a Writ, where his concernments are handled.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe of the contexture and interweaving, not only of Chriſt and the believers intereſts, but alſo of their Names in the ſame Writ. For in the Covenant where his Name is put alone as undertaker, and which is his ſingle bond, to wit, the Covenant of Suretiſhip; even there is the believers Name put, as being the perſon for which he payed a price, and for whom he undertook, and who were promiſed to him for a ſeed, as a ſatisfying-ſight for the travel of his Soul. And again, in the Writ given to us, we ſtand not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in Covenant-dealings with God; but in the ſame Writs of the promiſes made to the believer, Chriſts name ſtands as principal party Covenanting for us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the promiſes, as is manifeſt from what is already ſaid.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is not only a contexture, but a commutation with Chriſt and the believers Name in the Covenant-writs: for his Name is put in our Bond, for he wrote himſelf the <hi>ſinner</hi> (legally,) and in the ſinners place under the Law accurſed: and our Name is put in the Writ of Juſtification given to him, and the new Law of Faith writes the believer <hi>righteous and bleſſed,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21, <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Gal. 3.13, 14, <hi>Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us: for it is written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58137:79"/>tree. That the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the Gentles through faith.</hi> Rom. 3.22, <hi>Even the righteouſneſs of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. There is not only a commutation, but a community of Writs betwixt Chriſt and the Believer: for one Writ and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe-wreats, God, the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the God and Father of the Believer: this Covenant-relation to him and us, is by the great promiſes of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5, <hi>I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son.</hi> Pſal. 89.26, 29, <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of my ſalvation.—His ſeed alſo will I make to endure for ever.</hi> One Writ makes Chriſt the firſt Heir, and Son of the promiſe; and the Believer a younger Brother coming in under Chriſt the firſt Heir, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.27, <hi>Alſo I will make him my firſt-born.</hi> Gal. 3.26, <hi>For ye are all the children of God, by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Rom. 8.17, <hi>And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chriſt.</hi> One Writ and letter of acquittance diſchargeth both Chriſt and the Believer from the curſe and condemnation of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4, <hi>God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin the fleſh. That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> O how comfortable and ſtrengthening is this, that Chriſt and we are in one Writ, that our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant intereſts and relations to God, and all his and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments are thus bound up in one Writ! if his title to God, to Heaven, to promiſes, be good and valid, ours is ſo too; if he acquit and defend his own Charters, he doth the ſame for ours: bleſſed are they who are united to him in this New Covenant-relation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By the Covenant of Suretiſhip, Chriſt is conſtituted the grand Inſtrument and Actor of all things that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to his peoples Redemption and Salvation, and that not only of eternal Salvation and Redemption, which he alone brought unto his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9, <hi>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal ſalvation unto all them that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him.</hi> Heb. 9.15, <hi>And for this cauſe he is the mediator of the new Teſtament, that by means of death, for the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt teſtament, they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58137:80"/>who are called, might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi> Luk. 1.68, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for he hath viſited and redeemed his people:</hi> And of ſuch part of that Redemption as is wrought within time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by him:</hi> But of whatſoever Salvation and other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations are good for them in this life: And therefore we find that Chriſt was the grand Inſtrument, and had an active hand in the deliverance of his people from all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and oppreſſions in all ages, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.5, 9, <hi>And I looked, and there was none to help, and I wondred that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought ſalvation unto me, and my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it upheld me.—In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them; and in his love and in his pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</hi> It was Chriſt <hi>the Angel of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Mal. 3.1, who delivered <hi>Jacob from all evil,</hi> Gen. 48.16, It was he who brought the people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſaid to <hi>Moſes, And now come, I mill ſend thee unto Egypt.</hi> He it was who appeared unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh, and <hi>made him a ruler and a deliverer,</hi> Act. 7.32, 34, 35. It was he that brought the people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and built the temple, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.12, 13, <hi>Behold the man whoſe Name is the Branch, and he ſhall grow up out of his place, and he ſhall build the temple of the Lord. Even he ſhall build the temple of the Lord, and he ſhall bear the glory,</hi> &amp;c. If the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Salvation of the Church and people of God lay upon men, how cold a comfort were that? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.16, <hi>And he ſaw that there was no man, and wondred that there was no interceſſor.</hi> Pſal. 142.4, <hi>I looked on my right hand, and beheld, and there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me, and there was no man cared for my ſoul.</hi> And if the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that part of our Salvation which the Lord hath made the Believers Duty, and hath commanded him to do for his own Soul, if that lay upon us alone, how heavy would it prove? <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> But O how warm, how comfortable is it, what a ſupport to faith, that Chriſt is by his Suretiſhip engaged to work all manner of Salvation for his people, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the grand inſtrument, and chief actor thereof! <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.13,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58137:80"/>
                  <hi>I that ſpeak in righteouſneſs, mighty to ſave: I have trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the wine-preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me.</hi> Phil. 2.13, <hi>For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> Heb. 12.2, <hi>Looking unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. By the Covenant of Suretiſhip, all the hard conditions lay upon Chriſt; all that the Law requires of Man condition-ways: he <hi>was made under the law,</hi> Gal. 4.4, that we might <hi>not be under the law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6.14. O how ſweet and comfortable is it to the poor weak Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, who finds himſelf ſo very inſignificant a creature at all Covenant-conditions, to know that by Chriſts Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, 1. He did take upon him all conditions which the law requires of man, to abide in every thing that it requires: the Believer is yet under the commands of the Law; but I ſay not under the conditions thereof: for it is not to him a Covenant: Chriſt alſo did bear the curſe of the Law, but that which the Believer ſuffers even of the things that were ſometimes written in the book of the Law, are now written in the book of Covenant-mercies. 2. Chriſt did take upon him all the conditions that are works, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſts to the believer condition-wiſe, but that which is grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16, <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace.</hi> Its true, the Believer yet worketh, <hi>and is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated unto good works,</hi> Phil. 2.10, But all working condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-ways, was upon Chriſt by his Suretiſhip. 3. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and moſt ſignificant condition of Redemption, Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all Covenant-bleſſings and priviledges promiſed to us, is Chriſts doing his part of the Covenant of Suretiſhip; his laying down his life, this was not only a condition of the reward that was to be given to Chriſt perſonal, but even of all the promiſes that were made to him, concerning his redeemed ſeed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11, <hi>And the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his Soul, and ſhall be ſatisfied: by his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities.</hi> 4. By this Suretiſhip, beſide all that he hath fulfilled and done in his own perſon, he is under a Covenant to work in his people what God requireth condition-ways of them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, <hi>All that the father giveth me, ſhall come to me; and him
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58137:81"/>that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> O how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable is it, that Chriſt is under a Covenant to enjoy his Elect people, not for any thing they can do for themſelves, but for the work that he hath wrought, and the conditions that he hath fulfilled in his own perſon, and is obliged to fulfil and work in them. And indeed the promiſes are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled to us, not becauſe we fulfil the condition, but for Chriſt, in whom they are made to us, and who by his Suretiſhip did perform all conditions that the law doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That in the Covenant of Suretiſhip the Believer is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for by both the parties: 1. <hi>Jehovah</hi> undertakes, foraſmuch as he promiſes a redeemed ſeed to Chriſt, and engages that he ſhall ſee them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed.</hi> Now he who undertakes for this, muſt needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that they ſhall be born again; ſo that the Lord is undertaker for our believing, Juſtification, Perſeverance, and Salvation: then <hi>Jehovah</hi> is engaged by Covenant with Chriſt to make ſure our believing and Salvation, as he will be true to his Son, to whom he gave this promiſe, and to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his holy nature, for <hi>he cannot deny himſelf.</hi> 2. Chriſt hath undertaken for us alſo. He is <hi>made ſurety,</hi> Heb. 7.22. He hath given Bond for our believing, and Salvation; he hath by an eternal act of cautionry, acted himſelf for all them who ſhall believe on him, body for body, life for life, ſoul for ſoul, that his life ſhall go for theirs, that his ſoul ſhall be in their ſouls ſtead, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, <hi>When thou ſhall make his ſoul an offering for ſin.</hi> And by the Mediatory office that he took upon him, he hath laid Bonds upon himſelf, and made a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty of his office, to ſave his people, to become a <hi>Captain of Salvation</hi> to them, to <hi>bring many ſons to glory,</hi> Heb. 2.10. And that he will be faithful in this office he hath taken Bonds upon him, that by vertue of his office, and place, he muſt do whatſoever is for his peoples welfare: See <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1, 2, <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apoſtle and High-prieſt of our profeſſion, Chriſt Jeſus, who was faithful to him that appointed him.</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 17, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all thingsit behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-prieſt, in all things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people.</hi> How comfortable is this to the weak Believer? and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58137:81"/>how ſtrengthening to Faith, to conſider that <hi>Jehovah</hi> gave Bond from eternity to Chriſt, and ſtands engaged to him, for the bowing of our rebellious wills, and for ſuch a frame of heart to us, as our Redemption and Salvation neceſſarily requires! And that Chriſt ſtands engaged to be to all his own <hi>a merciful and faithful High-prieſt!</hi> and that by the Bonds he hath laid upon himſelf, it <hi>behoved him to</hi> be ſo! <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. O conſider! he can no more be unconcerned with our concernments, he can no more be untouched with, and want a feeling of our infirmities, than he can ceaſe to be a merciful and faithful High-prieſt; which qualifications he behoved to take upon him, by taking on that office, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2, 3. Chap. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 17. Chap. 4. <hi>v.</hi> 15. Chriſt can no more fail in any thing pertaining to our peace with God, and our Salvation, than he can break his faith of Suretiſhip, and fail in Covenant-faithfulneſs, and the Bonds that he hath given to <hi>Jehovah.</hi>

By the Covenant of Suretiſhip paſſed betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, the believer is in a ſure confirmed ſtate; he is not in a tottering, ſlippery, mutable condition, as were the Angels that fell, and like to Adams firſt Covenant-ſtate; but the believer is in a ſure confirmed ſtate, as ſure as the Elect Angels who never fell. 1.

By this Covenant the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſtanding and perſeverance is taken off the creatures mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table will, and is now upon the gracious immutable counſel of Gods will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, <hi>Wherein God, willing more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe, the immutability of his counſel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32, <hi>Fear not little flock, for it is your fathers good pleaſure to give you the kingdom.</hi> 4. By
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58137:82"/>this Covenant-ſalvation, the weight of Salvation is taken off the creatures acting, and laid upon Chriſts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6, <hi>That thou mayeſt be my ſalvation unto the end of the earth.</hi> Joh. 17.2, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> 5.

               <p n="11">11. Whatſoever Chriſt acted by the Covenant of Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he did it for us, and we did that in him. For, 1. Whatſoever he acted by vertue of the Covenant of Suretiſhip, he acted as a Surety. Now a Surety is one that undertakes and does for another, and whoſe deed by the allowance of the Law, ſtands for the deed of that perſon for whom he was undertaker: a perſon who puts himſelf in the ſtead of another; ſuch a perſon was <hi>Judah</hi> for <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> Gen. 43.9. Chap. 44.32. 2. Whatſoever he acted by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58137:82"/>vertue of this Covenant, he acted as a publick perſon, I do not ſay that in the tranſacting of the Covenant of Suretiſhip Chriſt acted as a publick perſon: for then fallen man ſhould be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker to ſatisfie juſtice, and to pay a price of blood to God for his own ſin, becauſe a perſon who repreſented him, did undertake this: but I ſay, after Chriſt perſonally conſidered, had by the Covenant of Suretiſhip taken upon him-this publick capacity and place, whatſoever he acted by doing or ſuffering, he acted ſtill as a publick perſon: Now a publick perſon is one who perſonates, repreſents and acts the part of another, ſo that what he doth <hi>(as ſuch)</hi> that other perſon whom he repreſents, is reckoned by the Law to do: ſuch publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt; the <hi>firſt man</hi> and the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the heads of two families, who repreſented all that came of them, their ſeed and heirs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22. Conſider, how comfortable this is to the believer, and what ſupport it affords to his faith; look over his ſtate, his condition, his actings, all that he was made, all that he did, all that was done to him; he was made, and did, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all that for the believer; and his Elect people were made, and did, and ſuffered, and received all that in him: when he died, God reckoned us dying then, and would have us reckon ſo alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.10, 11, <hi>For in that he died, he died unto ſin; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewiſe, reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> When he ſuffered and ſatisfied the Law, God reckoned that we did ſo alſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> When he was acquitted and diſcharged of the Debt, when he roſe again, and was releaſed from the Priſon and Bonds of the Law, we did ſo alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25, <hi>Who was delivered for our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and was raiſed again for our juſtification.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.20, 21, <hi>But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become the firſt fruits of them that ſlept. For ſince by man came death; by man alſo came the reſurrection of the dead.</hi> When he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into Heaven, and had reception, and a welcome of Covenant-favour, there we did ſo alſo, and had the ſame welcome, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6, <hi>And hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> For he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58137:83"/>acted all theſe things in our ſtead; and all theſe things were done to him, as a perſon repreſenting us.</p>
               <p n="12">12. By the Covenant of Suretiſhip, beſide all other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes in God, Juſtice it ſelf, that is moſt terrible to the believer, and was ſometimes a dreadful Attribute, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing leſs than Damnation to fallen man, is now turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be as much for the believers Salvation, as any other attribute in God: and upon that account is, and may be comfortably looked upon, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> If you ask, How can that be, that Juſtice ſhould be for the forgiveneſs of our ſins, if we do but confeſs them, though we can make no ſatisfaction to juſtice for them? Chriſt by his Suretiſhip hath brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the buſineſs, and handled the matter of Salvation ſo, that Juſtice and Righteouſneſs is as forward, as much engaged to ſave the believer, as any other Attribute in God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2, <hi>And he is the propitiation for our ſins: and not for our ſins only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> For, 1. Chriſt hath ſatisfied Juſtice by a condign-price, the price of the blood of a perſon who is God; he hath payed the believers Debt to the leaſt farthing. 2. He pleads this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and his own righteouſneſs for the people whoſe Debt he took upon him to pay; and thus he carried his matter by righteouſneſs and Juſtice. Now Juſtice, when 'tis ſatisfied and made for a perſon, is as comfortable, as 'tis terrible when it is unſatisfied, and againſt a perſon. How ſweet and comfortable is this to the believer, that by the Suretiſhip of Chriſt, not only favour and grace is for him, but Juſtice alſo? that ſatisfied Juſtice is the ſinful believers friend, ſtands on his ſide; and if God be righteous and juſt, he will, he muſt, he cannot but forgive the confeſſing-belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſave him upon Chriſts account, who ſuffered and ſatisfied <hi>punitive</hi> Juſtice, and merited by a condign-price, holding proportion with the thing which he bought, that <hi>communitative</hi> and <hi>remunerative</hi>-Juſtice ſhould give this reward for his work.</p>
               <p>Learn hence, 1. From the Covenant of Suretiſhip, to frame an anſwer to all temptations from our own frailty, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, inconſtancy, mixture of unbelief with faith, of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption

               <p>Three ways does this engage unto holineſs and becoming walking.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Morally, and by way of excitement and motive: the faith of Chriſts Suretiſhip and undertaking for us, is both an inviting, and encouraging motive to be holy, foraſmuch as we are choſen in Chriſt to be holy, and given to him to be made holy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17, <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> Heb. 2.11, <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By way of obligement: Chriſts Suretiſhip doth oblige us, and lay on Bonds and Obligations to this duty, that we ſhould believe and be holy: and he who hath the faith of Chriſts Suretiſhip cannot but judg ſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15, <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judg, that if one died for all, then were all dead. And that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20, <hi>For ye are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit, which are Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By way of real influence: the faith of Chriſts Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath real influence upon the believers heart, to make him ſtudy to walk like the redeemed people; if the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Law and Goſpel have ſome influence upon the ſpirit of man, to make him obey the Law or Goſpel, 'tis without doubt they have a moral influence; and when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the ſpirit, they have real influence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> Chap. 12. <hi>v.</hi> 25, <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven.</hi> Sure the gracious Covenant of Suretiſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

                  <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, the undertakings of Chriſt, for the believer muſt much more have influences upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſpirit, and really put him to it, to walk like a ranſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt; nevertheleſs, I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1, <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes, dearly beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord.</hi>

               <p n="7">7.

It was for his honour that he ſhould carry like a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour wronged: it became the Majeſty of the Lord to keep at a diſtance with ſinners, and not to be dealt with immediately by the parties who had done him the wrong; but by the Mediation and Interceſſion of another great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14, <hi>For I am a great king, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Heb. 7.25, Men muſt therefore <hi>come to God by him,</hi> by a Mediator. 2. It became the Majeſty and Honour of God to be dealt with only by his own Son, he being the greateſt Courtier in Heaven, and who knew moſt of his fathers mind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time: the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son which is in the boſome of the father, he hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For the glory of his Wiſdom: This was a plot becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wiſdom of God, and much for the honour of it, to find out this way of making up an union betwixt God and man. Again, by bringing down God to man, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up man to God, and treiſting both to meet in a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: wonderful did the wiſdom of God appear in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling Juſtice and Mercy, and making them meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this buſineſs; in puniſhing ſin, and ſetting the ſinner free; in making a Covenant with us through a Mediator, when there could be none without a Mediator, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10, 11, <hi>To the intent, that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the Church the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wiſdom of God: according to the eternal purpoſe which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It was for the glory of Gods Goodneſs and Free-grace, that grace may be acknowledged, and dealt with like Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; therefore there muſt be a Mediator, who through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the accompliſhment of our Salvation ſhall deal with grace by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58137:90"/>way of entreaty, and requeſts; and ſhall obtain our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as freely by requeſts, as if there had been no purchaſe made of it through ſatisfaction to Juſtice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.17, <hi>Who in the days of his fleſh, when he had offered up prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and tears unto him that was able to ſave him from death; and was heard in that he feared.</hi> Chap. 7. <hi>v.</hi> 25, <hi>Seeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It was for the glory of his Juſtice, which muſt be dealt with in a way of ſatisfaction: grace will be dealt with by requeſts, <hi>ſalva juſtitia,</hi> which muſt be dealt with by a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; therefore the Covenant is eſtabliſhed in the hands of a Mediator, who may tell down a price to Juſtice, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6, <hi>Who gave himſelf a ranſome for all, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> Theſe two the Apoſtle joyns, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25, 26, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt: Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God. To declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus.</hi> The higheſt Juſtice, and the freeſt grace, met together in the Mediator, to ſave us by paying a price as fully as if there had been no grace; and entreating of favour in the matter of our Salvation: and yet as much entreaty and requeſt is made to grace, as if Juſtice had received no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Other Reaſons reſpect Chriſt: the Covenant is eſtabliſhed in the hands of a Mediator, for the glory of the Mediator in this employment, whoſe honour and glory God had in his eyes, as well as his own, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23, <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</hi> And 16.14, <hi>He ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> Now the conſtituting and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Chriſt Mediator of the new Covenant, is for his honour, 1. In reſpect of the honourable offices which are laid upon him as Mediator: for it is as Mediator that he is conſtituted a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet to his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1, and 7 <hi>Chap.</hi> throughout, which are honourable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, <hi>And no man taketh this honour unto himſelf,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58137:91"/>but he that is called of God as was Aaron.</hi> Joh. 5.22, 23, <hi>But hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</hi> 2. In reſpect of the exceeding great power which is put in his hand as Mediator: no leſs than the adminiſtration of the whole affairs in Heaven and Earth, and <hi>that every knee ſhould bow to him,</hi> Phil. 2.10, <hi>And the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. Mat. 28.18, <hi>All power is given unto me in heaven, and in earth.</hi> Rev. 3.7, <hi>He that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man ſhutteth: and ſhutteth, and no man openeth.</hi> 3. In reſpect of the great dependance that ſhall be upon Chriſt Mediator, by many ſupplicants reſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and waiting on him, for the repreſenting and offering of their requeſts. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask of the Father in my name, he ſhall give it you.</hi> Zeph. 3.10, <hi>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my ſupplicants, even the daughter of my diſperſed ſhall bring mine offering.</hi> 4. In reſpect of his ſole and abſolute working of the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of our Salvation from beginning to end, every part of it being immediately from him as the Fountain and ſtore-houſe, and Great Lord Treaſurer of all the bleſſings of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, <hi>Looking unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith.</hi> Eph. 1.3, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt.</hi> Act. 2.33, <hi>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received of the Father the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this which ye now ſee and hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third ſort of Reaſons reſpecting the creatures good and happineſs, may be holden forth, 1. Negatively. 2. Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Without Chriſt the Mediator, we ſhould have had no knowledg of God which is ſaving: for ſince the fall, God dealeth not with man immediately: nor can man ſee him, or hear him ſpeak without a Mediator. This was typified, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.19, <hi>And they ſaid unto Moſes, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God ſpeak with us, leſt we die.</hi> But in the Mediator we ſee Gods face, and know him ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3, <hi>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58137:91"/>ſent.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6, <hi>To give the light of the knowledg of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Without Chriſt the Mediator, there could be no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt God and man: the diſtance was ſo great, that the parties could not come near to one another, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13, <hi>But now in Chriſi Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Without the Mediator there could not have been any communion with God: union is the foundation of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: without Chriſt the Creature ſhould everlaſtingly have loſt the fruition of God. <hi>Without Chriſt, and without God,</hi> go together, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Without the Mediator we could never had any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with God; we loſt the Image of God, but could never have regained it: but in Chriſt it is reſtored more excellently, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18, <hi>But we all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi> In a word: without a Mediator, no part of mans ſpiritual or everlaſting good ſhould have been brought to paſs; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as all the good which God had from eternity decreed to do to man, was decreed to come to him in and through a Mediator: hence we are ſaid to be choſen and ordained unto adoption, holineſs, obedience, perſeverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in and through him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt. According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving predeſtinated us unto the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2, <hi>Through ſanctification of the ſpirit unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by eſtabliſhing the Covenant in the hands of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, mans good is advanced. For, 1. There is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation laid of a higher happineſs to be recovered in Chriſt, than was loſt in <hi>Adam:</hi> for there is much more of God manifeſted and revealed in Jeſus Chriſt, than was in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for now we may <hi>behold his face as in a glaſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18, throughout. Chriſt, <hi>who is the brightneſs of his</hi> Fathers

                  <hi>glory,</hi> Heb. 1.3. Therefore this is a <hi>better Covenant,</hi> which hath <hi>better promiſes</hi> in it, laid to our hand in a Mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. 2. Not only a higher happineſs, and a better Covenant in that reſpect, but alſo through the Mediator there is a foundation laid of a better ſecurity for that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; a ſurer Covenant, and ſtanding in it, than was before: a Covenant that cannot be <hi>diſannulled,</hi> as was the firſt; this being eſtabliſhed, and <hi>ordained in the hands of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> Gal. 3.15, 17, 19. Jer. 31.33, <hi>But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my laws in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts: and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people,</hi> Chap. 33. <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. A happineſs that cannot be forefaulted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.33, 34, 35. 3. Through the eſtabliſhing of this Covenant in the hands of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, there is ſtrength and height of confidence and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, anſwerable to the ſecurity granted, and the ſolid grounds of confidence and comfort that are laid in this Covenant; the ſum whereof is, That all ſhall go well, notwithſtanding all things in us that ſpeak the contrary, becauſe there is a Mediator in this Covenant, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2, <hi>And if any man ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our ſins: and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> Heb. 7.25, <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them.</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 17, <hi>That he might be a merciful and faithful High-prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people.</hi> And truly if there had not been a Mediator in the Covenant of grace, in whoſe hand it was ordained, through whom it is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with us; it had been as weak, ineffectual, and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to give righteouſneſs and life, as the firſt Covenant proved.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. The neceſſity of a Mediator in this Covenant, cleareth one of the main differences betwixt the Covenant of Grace and the firſt Covenant which was of Works, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was no Mediator, nor need of a Mediator, the parties being friends, and in fitneſs to deal immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

Let natural men be convinced of this; you have none to deal for you, you muſt ſtand or fall by your own righteouſneſs without any mending of it; you muſt do for your ſelves, or be undone; for there is no Mediator of that Covenant under which you ſtand: you muſt do ſo, or of neceſſity come to Chriſt the Mediator, that you may partake in a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. 2. Let believers be convinced of this, It is not natural men only that need a Mediator to make their peace, and to change their Covenant-ſtate, but you alſo need a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: 1. At all times before, and after juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 10, <hi>For when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly.—For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi> In making your peace, and maintaining it: before, and in, and after your converſion, you will need a Mediator, till you be in over the threſhold of glory; till you have put off the body of ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, <hi>No man can come to me except the father which ſent me, draw him.</hi> Song. 1.4, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> Luk. 22.32, <hi>But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.</hi> 2.

In all things pertaining to God, whatſoever you have to do, if it be a thing that relates to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, <hi>That he might be a merciful and faithful High-prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people.</hi> If you have any direction to receive from God, if you have any bleſſing to receive, you need a Mediator to procure it to you, and to receive it for you: If you have any ſervice to offer to God, any duty to perform, you need a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor both to afford you ſtrength to perform it, and to offer
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58137:93"/>it to God for you: if you have any evil to deprecate, you need a Mediator to avert it, whether it be for ſins before, or after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. 1. In all caſes, not only in thy deadneſs, and indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions for duties, but when thy heart is in beſt frame, thy tenderneſs and good frame cannot mediate for thee, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3, 17, <hi>And I ſet my face unto the Lord God to ſeek by prayers and ſupplications, with faſting, and ſack-cloath, and aſhes.—Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy ſervant, and his ſupplications, and cauſe thy face to ſhine upon thy ſanctuary that is deſolate, for the Lords ſake.</hi> Iſa. 38.3, 14, <hi>And Hezekiah wept ſore.—Like a Crane or a Swallow ſo did I chatter, I did mourn as a Dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O Lord, I am oppreſſed, undertake for me.</hi> Not only when thou art at diſtance with God, and canſt not find acceſs, but when thou art neareſt to him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his preſence, to ſpeak before his throne, then thou needeſt a Mediator; not only for eſtabliſhing thee in that good condition, but for covering the evil of thy beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6, <hi>But we are all as an unclean thing, and our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags.</hi> Chap. 6. <hi>v.</hi> 5, <hi>Then ſaid I, Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips; and I dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have ſeen the king, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>

Shut him not out of his office in any thing that is a matter betwixt God and you: think not to put him to drudg at your burdens, and to ſlight him in other things: he will not be ſo dealt with. 4. Let us beware of tempting Chriſt, of grieving the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: if you carry about with you the freſh conviction of your need of him, you will be very tender and wary of tempting him, and ſinning againſt him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9, <hi>Neither let us tempt Chriſt as ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of Serpents.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. This is he who is called the <hi>brightneſs of his Fathers glory,</hi> Heb. 1.3. As Chriſt is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And here let us, 1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The brightneſs,</hi> or <hi>ſent-forth Light</hi> here ſpoken of, is a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58137:95"/>ſimilitude taken from the Sun; wherein there is the body of the Sun, there is the light of the Sun, and the ſhining ſplendor or beams of the Sun: Interpreters think this to be an expreſſion of the eternal generation of the Son, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Father, as light from the Sun. I take it rather to be the manifeſtation of the Father in Chriſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who is otherwiſe inviſible: as the Sun is manifeſted by its own light, ſo that if you would light all the Torches in the world, you cannot ſee the Sun by the light of theſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its own light: No more can you ſee God but in Chriſt Jeſus; who is the brightneſs of his Glory, the light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his excellencies are manifeſted, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9, <hi>That was the true light which-lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> Mat. 11.27, <hi>Neither knoweth any man the Father, ſave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him.</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>the imprinted form,</hi> this ſimilitude relates to the perſons of the Godhead, as the former did to the Divine Eſſence and Nature. It is borrowed from the ſignets impreſſion, which repreſents all the lineaments of the Seal, the Character is the perfect expreſſed Image. Mark, Chriſt is called the <hi>Image</hi> of Gods <hi>Perſon, not of his Eſſence;</hi> for he is the ſame Eſſence, not the ſame Perſon. There is in the God-head <hi>eſſentia &amp; ſubſiſtentia;</hi> the Eſſence is but one, but the Subſiſtences or Perſons are different, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Scripture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7, <hi>For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy-Ghoſt:</hi> I take not this to be meant of Chriſt, as God prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally: for ſo he is the ſame in Nature, Names and Atrri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; rather than the Image of God: but I underſtand it of Chriſt as Mediator, in whom there is a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reſemblance of the Fathers Attributes and Excellencies.</p>
               <p>And here for our knowledg of the perſon who is Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, I lay down two concluſions from that comprehenſive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of him: 1. That Jeſus Chriſt hath in him a glorious reſemblance, and a perfect Character of all the glorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and Attributes of the Father, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9, <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18, <hi>But we all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord.</hi> 2. That it is by Chriſt Mediator, that all the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58137:95"/>glorious excellencies of God are revealed unto us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, <hi>For God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider, 1. That Gods great end in all his goings forth towards the Creature, in Predeſtination, Creation, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, &amp;c. is his own glory, and the manifeſtation of his excellency, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4, <hi>The Lord hath made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</hi> Rom. 11.36, <hi>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for evor.</hi> Rev. 4. laſt, <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> But more eſpecially this is his end in Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6, <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> Joh. 17.4, <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> 2. That which is Gods end, is our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; even to have God manifeſted to us, to ſee him, and to have diſcoveries made to us of his excellencies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3, <hi>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Mat. 5.8, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2, <hi>But we know when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> To ſee him, and be transformed by that ſight, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18, <hi>But we all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord.</hi> 3. The way of Gods attaining his end, and our attaining our happineſs (which are both one), the way (I ſay) is alſo one: it is in Chriſt the Mediator that God is manifeſted, and in him do we ſee God; the knowledg of his glory and our happineſs are both <hi>in the face of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. All the excellencies of God are manifeſted in Chriſt, he revealeth the myſteries, 1. Of his will as he is <hi>the Word.</hi> 2. Of his nature as he is the <hi>brightneſs of his Glory.</hi> 3. Of the ſubſiſtences and diſtinction of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as he is the <hi>Image of his Perſon;</hi> he only knows the Father, and he only can reveal the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, <hi>He is the image of the inviſible God,</hi> i.e. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58137:96"/>of God (otherwiſe inviſible) are revealed by him, and to be ſeen in him.</p>
               <p>Theſe three things of God are diſcovered in Jeſus Chriſt. 1. The Attributes of God. 2. The diſtinct ſubſiſtences of the perſons of the God-head. 3. The diſtinct offices of the three Perſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a full manifeſtation of the Attributes of God in Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator of the new Covenant; theſe Attributes that were never manifeſted before, Mercy and Long-ſuffering, are revealed in him; and theſe that were manifeſted before, ſhine mort brightly through Chriſt. 1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Goodneſs of God is manifeſted in Jeſus Chriſt; his goodneſs and love to man appeared much at firſt in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of the rank of the higheſt creatures on earth, and putting all the reſt of the Creatures under his feet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.5, 6, <hi>For thus haſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58137:96"/>he bringeth in the firſt begotten into the world, he ſaith, And let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> This is a higher pitch of the love of God, this is the goodneſs of God more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted than ever before, to give his Son Chriſt for man, and his Son to become ſin, and a curſe for man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but haeve everlaſting life.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. laſt, <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us that knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Gal. 3.13, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Mercy of God is eminently manifeſted in Jeſus Chriſt: man is made to riſe by his fall: Mercy never ſaw the light before; it was never revealed but in Jeſus Chriſt: for it reſpects the creature in its miſery, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.72, 78, <hi>To perform the mercy promiſed to our fathers, and to remember his holy Covenant.—Through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us.</hi> When all the poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> were as fuel for the fire, mercy reſcues and reſerves ſome to be ſons and heirs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23, <hi>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Power of God is manifeſted in Chriſt: God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his power in the Creation, as we read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.12, <hi>Who hath meaſured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out heaven with the ſpan, and comprehended the duſt of the earth in a meaſure, and weighed the mountains in ſcales, and the hills in a balance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 38, &amp;c. But what is this to the taking of our nature, and uniting it in a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal union with the Son of God? that God ſhould become man; the Ancient of Days become a Child: the Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to become comprehenſible! <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9, <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the God-head bodily.</hi> The inviſible God to become viſible, and to dwell here as in a tabernacle with men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14, <hi>And the word was made fleſh, and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Soveraignty of God is manifeſted in and through
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58137:97"/>Chriſt; great was the Soveraignty of God that was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in predeſtination, in making of veſſels of honour or diſhonour, according to the pleaſure of his will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21, 22, 23, <hi>Hath not the potter power over the clay of the ſame lump, to make one veſſel unto honour, and another unto diſhonour? What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction: And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy which he had before prepared unto glory?</hi> But all this was Soveraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the creature: but that Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God ſhould be appointed a Mediator of the new Covenant, made a Servant, commanded to lay down his life, this is greater Soveraignty, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38, <hi>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> Chap. 10. <hi>v.</hi> 18, <hi>This commandment have I received of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Juſtice of God is manifeſted in Chriſt: Juſtice was ſeen in caſting off the Angels that fell without hope: and in executing the ſentence and curſe of the firſt Covenant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Adam,</hi> for his tranſgreſſion thereof: but the world never heard of ſuch manifeſtation of Juſtice as appears in the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt to Juſtice; That Chriſt the Son of God is made ſin for us, and being made ſo in obedience to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers command, Juſtice ſpares him not, but he muſt be ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to death, that ſatisfaction may be made for ſin in our nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up for us all.</hi> Iſa. 53.8, <hi>For the tranſgreſſions of my people was he ſtricken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The Holineſs of God is manifeſted in Chriſt: his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did appear in that holy Image which he put in <hi>Adam,</hi> and the holy Law which he gave to him under a penalty: but this holineſs of the Image of God ſtamped on the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was poſſible to be loſt, for both men and Angels were capable of ſin, and did fall: but herein is a greater mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Gods holineſs, that a Creature, Chriſt-man, Chriſt Mediator, is made the Fountain of all Holineſs, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot be loſt in him; yea, it is derived from him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14, 16, <hi>Full of grace and truth, and of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>v.</hi> 34, <hi>For God
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58137:97"/>giveth not the ſpirit by meaſure unto him.</hi> This is ſpoken of Chriſt man, of Chriſt Mediator; for one of the perſons of the Godhead cannot receive another. O what an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Holineſs is this! what a communication and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Holineſs of God! <hi>The fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwells bodily</hi> in the man Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. Where there is the higheſt union, there is the greateſt communion; there was never ſuch another union as that perſonal union, and therefore there could never be ſuch a communication of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The All-ſufficiency of God appears more in Chriſt than ever before: the declarative glory thereof ſhines in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of loſt man: for whoſoever can reſtore loſt man, can raiſe him to a higher happineſs than he fell from; he is All-ſufficient, and Almighty, and is thereby declared to be ſo, this did God in Chriſt the Mediator: this is a declaration of Gods All-ſufficiency, and of Chriſts, Gen. 17.1, <hi>I am God almighty.</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9, <hi>For ye know the grace of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that though he was rich, yet for your ſakes he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor, that ye through his poverty might be made rich.</hi> Chap. 12.9, <hi>And he ſaid unto me, My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs: moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The Patience and Long ſuffering of God was never heard of before, until it was manifeſted in Chriſt. God executed his Juſtice againſt the fallen Angels, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing any Patience and Long-ſuffering towards them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, <hi>For if God ſpared not the Angels which fell, but caſt them down to hell.</hi> But in Jeſus Chriſt there is a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Patience of God, and his bearing with ſinners, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8, <hi>There is a Covenant to eſtabliſh the earth,</hi> that Juſtice do not ruine it. Jeſus Chriſt obtained pardon and reprival for ſome ſinners, that they ſhould be ſpared, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, <hi>And the Lord paſſed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful, and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth.</hi> In him the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims himſelf <hi>merciful, and gracious, long-ſuffering,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, <hi>Howbeit, for this cauſe I obtained mercy, that in me firſt Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering, for a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58137:98"/>pattern to them which ſhould hereafter believe on him to life everlaſting.</hi> Yea, and by way of concomitancy, and for the Elects ſake, reprobates reap ſome benefit by the Patience of God thus manifeſted. He ſuffers the creatures to mock him, and ſay, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> 2 Pet. 3.4. Rom. 9.22, <hi>Endured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The Faithfulneſs of God is manifeſted in Chriſt: he was known to be true and faithful, in fulfilling the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and certification of the tranſgreſſion of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die.</hi> And in keeping the Covenant with all the creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.22, <hi>While the earth remaineth, ſeed-time, and harveſt-time, and cold, and heat, and ſummer, and winter, and day and night ſhall not ceaſe,</hi> Jer. 33.20, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, If ye can break my Covenant of the day, and my Covenant of the night, and that there ſhould not be day and night in their ſeaſon,</hi> &amp;c. But this was but a ſmall declaration of his faithfulneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared with the manifeſtation of his Faithfulneſs in Chriſt, which ſhines ſo brightly in keeping Covenant and Promiſes with him, and with his people upon his account, notwithſtanding all your unfaithfulneſs to him: hereby he is proclaimed to be the <hi>Lord, abundant in truth.</hi> Exod. 34.6. 2 Cor. 1.20, <hi>For all the promiſes of God in him are yea, and in him are Amen.</hi> Pſal. 89.34, 35, <hi>My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.

The Majeſty of the Lord, ſomething whereof is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the Creation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1, <hi>The heavens declare the glory of the Lord, and the firmament ſheweth forth his handy-work.</hi> But much more in reſtoring man; if there be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7, <hi>And of his Angels he ſaith, who maketh his Angels ſpirits, and his miniſters a flame of fire.</hi> And in godly men, which is but a little diſcovered here, &amp;c. ſhall be more fully afterward, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10, <hi>When he ſhall come to be glorified in his ſaints.</hi> O what excellent Majeſty

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The diſtinct Subſiſtences of the Perſons of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and bleſſed Trinity, are more brightly diſcovered in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, than ever before: God was but darkly ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the diſtinct Subſiſtences of the perſons of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but in the Goſpel, through Jeſus Chriſt, there is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manifeſtation thereof, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, <hi>For God, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Eternal Son of God, the ſecond Perſon, his taking on our nature, doth clearly ſhew that there are diſtinct Subſiſtences or Perſons in the Godhead: There are two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one Subſiſtence or Perſon, which illuſtrates the three Subſiſtencies in one nature, or three Perſons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By Jeſus Chriſt, from his own mouth, and in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying as Mediator, there were many bright diſcoveries of this great myſtery, as we may read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16, 17, <hi>And Jeſus, when he was baptized, went up ſtraight-way out of the waters: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the ſpirit of God deſcending like'd dove, and lighting upon him, And lo, a voice from heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Chap. 28. <hi>v.</hi> 28, <hi>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy-Ghoſt.</hi> Joh. 14.16, 26, <hi>And I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he may abide with you for ever.—But the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is the holy-Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:58137:99"/>3. The diſtinct Offices of the three Perſons, or their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered adminiſtration and working, and the various and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct acts of the Trinity, in the work of redemption, are brightly diſcovered in and by Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10, <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began; but is now made manifeſt by the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> But becauſe theſe may be gathered from what hath been ſpoken of the Covenant of Suretiſhip or Redemption, I ſhall only touch upon them in this place. And, 1. The Acts of the Father plotting and making the Covenant with Chriſt Mediator. 1.

               <p n="2">2. The Acts of Jeſus Chriſt undertaking: 1. He conſents

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of Chriſts Calling to the Office of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</head>
               <p>THis being the Perſon who is Mediator of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: We come in the next place to ſpeak of the Office. And, 1. Of Chriſts Calling to it. 2. Of his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for it. 3. Of his carriage in it. And firſt we ſhall enquire after Chriſts Calling to the office of Mediatorſhip, which we ſhall ſhortly diſpatch by anſwering of theſe three Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Q. 1. How came Chriſt to undertake this work? <hi>A.</hi> He was called to it: he did not intrude himſelf in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Office, but was ſent and employed in the work: theſe things clear his calling to the work. 1. Several of his <hi>Names</hi> import it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1, He is called the <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Covenant.</hi> Becauſe of his miſſion, and Gods ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him to do this work, &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>My ſervant,</hi> and <hi>mine elect.</hi> Becauſe of his being called, and employed by his Father: he was called a <hi>Servant</hi> or choſen Officer, formed for a ſpecial imployment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.5, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his ſervant, to bring Jacob again to him.</hi> Phil. 2.7, <hi>And took upon him the form of a ſervant.</hi> 2. He is about the work of Mediation by <hi>Office,</hi> and not by medling without his ſtation; which alſo ſheweth his calling to the Work, inaſmuch as he was about it by Office, as his duty, in his Calling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1, <hi>Conſider the Apoſtle and High-prieſt of our profeſſion Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Chap. 5.10, <hi>Called of God an High-prieſt, after the order of Melchiſidec.</hi> And this is pointed at by all theſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58137:100"/>Scriptures which make mention of the things that Chriſt did as Mediator; he did them <hi>ex officio,</hi> by vertue of ſome tye and obligation to do them, as duties of his Office: hence we find the holy-Ghoſt uſing the words, <hi>muſt, neceſſity, became him, behoved,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10, 17, <hi>For it became him, for whom are all things. Wherefore in all all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren.</hi> Chap. 8. <hi>v.</hi> 3, <hi>Wherefore it is of neceſſity that this man have ſomewhat alſo to offer.</hi> Joh. 4.4, <hi>And he muſt needs go through Samaria.</hi> 3. He is in Office not by intruſion, but by <hi>annointing,</hi> which imports lawful calling and miſſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2, <hi>The Lord and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</hi> Joh. 1.41, <hi>We have found the Meſſias, which is, being interpreted, the Chriſt.</hi> So the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſhews of all his three Offices. 4. The Scriptures plainly holds it forth, and the more ſtrongly, that it is held forth both Negatively and Affirmatively, denying any intruſion on Chriſts part, and affirming a calling from God to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5, <hi>And no man taketh this honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf, to be made an High-prieſt: but he that ſaid to him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</hi> Gal. 4.4, <hi>But when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38, 39, 40, 44, Chriſt doth frequently make mention of <hi>the will of him that ſent him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 2. By whom was Chriſt called unto the Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip? <hi>A.</hi> By God his Father, not excluding the other two perſons of the Trinity, though for orders ſake it be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Father, the fountain of divine operations, Col. 1.19, <hi>For it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> Joh. 6.27, <hi>For him hath God the Father ſealed, i.e.</hi> ſet apart, deſigned, and fitted for this Office: that he was called unto this Office by God, the Scripture ſpeaketh plainly, Pſal. 89.19, <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one choſen o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of the people.</hi> Heb. 5.5, 6, 10, <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an High-prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee. As he ſaith alſo in another place, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the Order of Melchiſedec—called of God an High prieſt after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> And 3.2, <hi>Who was faithful to him that appointed him.</hi> And that he could
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58137:101"/>be called by no other, may appear, 1. From the Antiquity of his calling to this Office, which was before all created beings, Prov. 8.23, <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</hi> He was elected to this in order, before we were elected to ſalvation, Pſal. 89.3, <hi>I have made a covenant with my choſen.</hi> Eph. 1.4, <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world.</hi> 2. From the end of the Office of a Mediator, which was Reconciliation: now who could find out a fit perſon, and call him to undertake this work, but he that had found out the way and means of Reconciliation; which was God only, for man did neither ſeek nor plot a peace with God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, <hi>It pleaſed the Father by him to reconcile all things to himſelf.</hi> Pſal. 89.19, <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty.</hi> 3. From the nature of the Office of Mediatorſhip, which is an Office of Inferiority, a ſervice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28, <hi>Even as the Son of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſome for many,</hi> Iſa. 42.2. Chap. 53. <hi>v.</hi> 11. Now who could deſign Chriſt, call or ordain, and command him unto an Office of Inferiority, (although by voluntary diſpenſation), but God only? <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18, <hi>For this commandment have I received of my Father.</hi> 4. From the Impoſſibility under which the creature ſtood to find any days-man, except God had found one, and called him to it; amongſt all the Creatures there was none that durſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this cauſe, or could deſign another to undertake it, <hi>viz.</hi> To interpoſe betwixt the Creator and the Creature, <hi>Job</hi> 9.33, <hi>Neither is there any days-man betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us.</hi> 1 Sam. 2.25, <hi>If one man ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, the judg ſhall judg him: but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 3. When was Chriſt called to be Mediator of the new Covenant? <hi>A.</hi> For the clearing of this: Conſider, that Chriſts calling to the Office of Mediatorſhip may import three things, his <hi>Deſignation,</hi> his <hi>Furniture,</hi> his <hi>Inveſtiture</hi> in the Office; Now according as the queſtion relateth to theſe parts of his Calling, ſo it requireth different An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſts Calling, or <hi>Deſignation</hi> to the Office of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the Covenant, is eternal; he was choſen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58137:101"/>hereunto before-time, even from all eternity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> was ſet up by the Father <hi>from everlaſting,</hi> deſigned and appointed unto this high and honourable Office and employment, to be Mediator of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; yea, it muſt be ſo, 1. Since Gods Covenant with Chriſt is eternal, and his chuſing and deſignation of Chriſt to be Mediator, is in order of nature, before his Covenant with Chriſt: for it preſuppoſeth him to be Mediator, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.3, <hi>I have made a Covenant with my choſen.</hi> 2. Becauſe our election preſuppoſeth Chriſt firſt choſen before us as the head of the Elect, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. Therefore we are ſaid to be <hi>choſen in Chriſt,</hi> i. e. as members of the head, or through him as Mediator, although Chriſt be not the cauſe of Election, or of Gods Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt's calling to be Mediator, in reſpect of his <hi>Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> for executing that Office whereunto he was deſigned before time; and in reſpect of his being <hi>inveſted</hi> in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it is in time, to wit, when he was anointed, which was at two times eſpecially:</p>
               <p n="1">1. When he took our nature upon him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When he was to appear in the publick execution of his Offices; whereof more particularly when I come to ſpeak of his Unction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If Chriſt be called unto this Office of Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by God his Father from all eternity; Then 1. wonder at the eternal love of God, and let your hearts be raiſed up to adore the unſearchable riches of grace and wiſdom manifeſted in Gods early calling Chriſt to an Office and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for our ſake, and Chriſts voluntary ſubmiſſion to it. He knew well enough it would be too late to wait for our call: He knew that we might dye in our ſin, before we ſent for the Phyſician: he did well foreſee our ſlowneſs and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to give him employment for making our peace; and therefore he prevented us, <hi>John</hi> 8.27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This may eſtabliſh our hearts in the faith of the weight and prevalency of Chriſts Mediation; he being no Uſurper, but a called choſen perſon, ſet in lawful Authority, all whoſe travels receive weight from his Place and Calling: for becauſe he was ſent, and had a commandment to travel in the work of his peoples Redemption, therefore the work
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58137:102"/>that was ſet him to do, muſt proſper, and his travels with both the parties muſt prevail, Joh. 10.36, <hi>Say ye of him whom the Father hath ſanctified and ſent unto the world, Thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid I am the Son of God?</hi> Iſa. 53.10, 11, <hi>By his knowledg ſhall my righteous Servant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſhould bear upon us a neceſſity of receiving the Mediator in his travels about Reconciliation. He is in his Office, and called to travel with you about this work; take heed how you entertain and anſwer his propoſitions of peace, now he is making propoſals of peace to you by virtue of this Office which he bears; 2 Cor. 6.2, <hi>Behold, now is the accepted time: behold, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> Ch. 5. <hi>v.</hi> 20, <hi>Now then we are ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God.</hi> Heb. 2.1, 3, <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things that we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip—How ſhall we eſcape if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> Your ſlighting of the Goſpel, beſide the neglect of ſo great ſalvation brought to you in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, hath alſo in it great ſlighting of a choſen Officer, and of a Perſon called and put in high authority by God, to travel with you in the buſineſs of your peace, Heb. 12.25, <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh; for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This ſpeaks comfort to believers, Chriſt is Mediator betwixt God and you, by an eternal call from God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he needs not much entreaty to be about the Office whereunto he is called of God (although it be no leſs your duty to entreat his favour as the Diſciples did, than if he had no other calling to it, but your invitation), <hi>Luke</hi> 24.29, <hi>But they conſtrained him, ſaying, Abide with us, for it is towards evening, and the day is far ſpent: and he went in to tarry with them.</hi> If you ſhould at any time apprehend that he would refuſe your entreaties (which you have no ground to think), yet he will not, he cannot ſhake off his Father's calling to mediate for you; he dealeth betwixt God and you
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58137:102"/>by virtue of an Office, which having taken upon him by voluntary ſubmiſſion, the duties of that Office lye upon him through a bleſſed neceſſity, as is written of the High-Prieſt who was a type of him, That by <hi>reaſon hereof,</hi> to wit, of his Office, <hi>he ought to offer for ſins,</hi> Heb. 5.3. And 8.3, <hi>For every High-prieſt is ordained to offer gifts and ſacrifices: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of neceſſity that this man have ſomewhat alſo to offer.</hi> Comfort your ſelves, believers in Chriſt, that beſides all the ſupports of your faith, which you may have from his union of nature with you, and his unction; from his propriety in you, and conſanguinity with you; from his gracious qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for that work; you have this moreover, That he is your Mediator by Calling, by Office, and can no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline any thing that may be for your good, than he can be unanſwerable to his Fathers Calling, or unfaithful in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and in the performing the duties thereof, which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>

               <p>And 1. of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, and taking our nature upon him, which I call the chief and grand qualification of him for Mediatorſhip. This is a fundamental truth, and yet a great myſtery. We think we know this ſo well, that it is below us to ſtudy it, to preach it, and to hear of it; but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58137:103"/>you are not at the bottom of your unbelief and ignorance, if you know not that this myſtery is little known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh, ſeen of Angels,</hi> with ſtudy and delight, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. We ſhall conſider, 1. The reality of his human nature, and the aſſuming of it. 2. The tranſcendent love and condeſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhewed by the Son of God in the taking our nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. 3. The honour and exaltation of our nature; yea, and of us, by Jeſus Chriſt his taking it into a perſonal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Divine nature. 4. How or in what reſpects the taking of our nature upon him did qualifie him to be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the New Covenant. 5. Something for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome queſtions relating to this Myſtery.</p>
               <p>And 1. He took our nature really upon him: Jeſus Chriſt became truly man, as kindly a man as ever lived, <hi>verus ſed non merus homo,</hi> true man, but not meer man. That word <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, <hi>ſimilitude of fleſh,</hi> is put for ſameneſs, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves, <hi>Non quia caro non erat caro, ſed quia peccati caro non erat.</hi> Chriſts manhood was a true nature, yet no ſinful nature, but had only the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> or <hi>likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> becauſe he bare all our infirmities in which we lay through ſin: And it may appear thus: 1. Jeſus Chriſt hath taken mans <hi>nature</hi> upon him, Heb. 2.16, <hi>For verily he took not on him the nature of angels, but he took upon him the ſeed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>he catched at it, took hold of it;</hi> it properly ſignifies to catch one who is running away, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in a pit; to fetch back or recover again: the ſame word that's uſed of Chriſt's catching hold of <hi>Peter</hi> when he was like to ſink, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.31, it is anſwerable to the word uſed <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.16, of the Angels laying hold on <hi>Lot</hi>'s hand. So did Chriſt in taking our nature upon him. 2. He took all the parts of a man, body and ſoul, Mat. 26.38, <hi>Then ſaith he unto them, My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful unto death.</hi> Heb. 10.5, <hi>A body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> Luke 24.39, <hi>Behold my hands and my feet</hi> (that it is I my ſelf); <hi>handle me and ſee; for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones as ye ſee me have.</hi> 3.

He took upon him all the ſinleſs infirmities of a man, to hunger, thirſt, be weary, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, in Chriſts taking our nature upon him, his condeſcending love: union betwixt God and man was the great deſign intended through the Mediator; this is brought about by his condeſcenſion, and our exaltation: where love is, it will ſtoop, and the greater condeſcenſion, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love.</p>
               <p>Theſe things hold forth infinite condeſcending in Chriſts taking our nature upon him. 1. Conſider who condeſcends thus: The higher that the perſon be who condeſcends, the more love is in his condeſcenſion: if it be a great conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending for God to look down upon things here below, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.46, <hi>The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens; who humbleth himſelf to behold the things in the heaven, and in the earth:</hi> What then muſt it be for the Son of God to take upon him the form of a Creature! <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. But made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of man.</hi> That he that made the world ſhould be <hi>made of a woman!</hi> That the immortal God ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mortal fleſh! it were a great condeſcenſion, that the ſoul of a man ſhould enter into a worm, or that all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhould become worms; yet that were nothing to Chriſts ſtooping to take our nature upon him. 2. Conſider what he took upon him, not our perſon, but our nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58137:104"/>16, <hi>The ſeed of Abraham,</hi> our fleſh and blood, that is our nature: many can be content to take upon them the perſons of men, to repreſent them, who yet would not be willing to take their nature; but Chriſt took our nature. 3. The end wherefore he took our nature upon him, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth yet more of his condeſcending. 1. It was that he might ſuffer, and that he might die for us in that nature, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, <hi>And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto the death, even the death of the croſs. Non ad gloriam ſed ad ignominiam,</hi> to be abaſed in our nature. 2. It was for our good, not for any thing that it could profit him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. <hi>To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> 4. He took our nature upon him, not for a day, or a ſhort time, but to continue ſo: It may be a Prince at a Masque for a little time might be moved to take the form of a ſervant upon him; but to continue ſo, he would not be moved: but here is infinite condeſcenſion, Chriſt takes our nature upon him, and keeps it ſtill, he will come again in our nature to judg the world, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11, <hi>This ſame Jeſus which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up from you into heaven, ſhall come in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into heaven.</hi> Chap. 17. <hi>v.</hi> 31, <hi>Becauſe he hath appointed a day in the which he will judg the world in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by that man whom he hath ordained.</hi> Though he doth nothing now in Heaven, but acts of Majeſty, being a <hi>Prieſt ſet upon the right hand of the throne of Majeſty,</hi> Heb. 8.1. Yet he will do thoſe acts in our nature; yea, when he ſhall <hi>deliver up the kingdom,</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. the Kingdom which he hath received as Mediator, he will not lay down our nature, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. 5. Conſider the time when he took our nature upon him; not when our nature was a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but when it was defiled; not mans nature in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but in his ſinful, corrupted, condemned, accurſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, <hi>In the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh.</hi> Chap. 5. <hi>v.</hi> 10, <hi>When we were enemies,</hi> and when all the Creatures did hate us; when we were not worth the following, then he did thus condeſcend to love us, and follow us. 6. Conſider the manner of his taking our nature upon him. 1. He doth not perſonate our nature, but is <hi>made fleſh, Joh.</hi> 1.14. 2. He does it voluntarily and chearfully, and with earneſt
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58137:104"/>deſire, when we were not following him, but fleeing away from him, he himſelf roſe out of his place and followed after us, and <hi>caught</hi> our nature, as the words ſignifies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7, <hi>And took upon him the form of a ſervant.</hi> Pſal. 40.7, <hi>Then ſaid he, Lo, I come.</hi> 3. He takes our nature upon him, with all the infirmities of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren.</hi> Chap. 4. <hi>v.</hi> 15, <hi>For we have not an High-prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted, like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> He would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend ſo far, that in all things he would be like us (ſin only excepted); and even in that, though he took not the corruption of ſin, yet he took upon him the guilt of our ſin, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. laſt, <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin.</hi> He was legally the ſinner, though not intrinſecally), and the puniſhment thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law being made a curſe for us.</hi> He was content to be <hi>numbred with the tranſgreſſors,</hi> Iſa. 53.12. He was content to be puniſhed for our ſins, even by God his Father. And, which is yet wonderful, that he might come as near to us as poſſible, he was content to condeſcend to be tempted to the thing wherewith it was impoſſible that he could be tainted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.2. To be <hi>tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Devil</hi> to ſin, and yet the <hi>Prince of the world had nought in him,</hi> Joh. 14.20. 7. Conſider the compariſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the Holy-Ghoſt, which doth yet further and more ſignificantly expreſs this condeſcending-love, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. It was a favour which he denied to the Angels, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>not at all,</hi> or <hi>not in any wiſe;</hi> he neither looked after nor ſent, nor went after the Angels; he neither followed them nor took hold of their nature, nor ſuffered them to take hold of him; though theſe glorious ſpirits were incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably far above us, that Chriſt would manifeſt himſelf, not in the moſt glorious Creatures, but in our fleſh, was ſtrange condeſcenſion!</p>
               <p n="3">3. In Chriſts taking our nature, we are to conſider the honour and exaltation of our nature, and of us in that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And, 1. That it may appear what honour is conferred upon our nature by Chriſt aſſuming it into the perſonal union with the Godhead,</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:58137:105"/>
               <p>Conſider, 1. The nearer that any Creature is to God, the greater honour is put upon it. It is the honour of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are under ordinances, that they have God near to them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7, <hi>For what nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things, that we call upon him for?</hi> It is a more eſpecial honour of thoſe that have offices in the houſe of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, <hi>And no man taketh this honour unto himſelf.</hi> Now there is a threefold union; 1. <hi>Moral,</hi> ſo were men and Angels uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the fall. 2. <hi>Myſtical,</hi> ſo are Believers united a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, and with Chriſt. 3. <hi>Hypoſtatical,</hi> ſo is our nature united with the divine nature in the Perſon of Chriſt; there is a perſonal union of our nature with God; this is the neareſt union, and therefore the higheſt honour and exaltation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.4, <hi>Being made ſo much better than the Angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent name then they.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the Sonſhip that Chriſt hath as Mediator, whereby our nature is alſo highly exalted; the Son of God and our nature have but one Sonſhip; for <hi>ſiliatio eſt perſonae,</hi> Heb. 1.5, <hi>For unto which of the Angels, ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I will be to him a Father, and he ſhall be to me a Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider the glorious communion that our nature hath by this union with the Son of God, 'tis a high and great communion, that Angels and the ſpirits of juſt men are made perfect, have with God; but the communion that our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath with Chriſt, is far higher, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13, <hi>And no man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</hi> Even the man Chriſt is Gods <hi>fellow,</hi> Zech. 13.7, This is high communion indeed, whereby all the will of God is known to him, and ſo to our nature, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19, <hi>For it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. What honour is it, that our nature ſhould be the Treaſury and Store-houſe of all the good which God intends to diſpenſe to men and Angels? <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9, <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi> Divines call the humane nature <hi>Canalis gratiae,</hi> Eph. 1.22, <hi>And hath
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58137:105"/>put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. What honour is it that all the Creatures ſhould wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in our nature? <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6, <hi>And again, when he bringeth in the firſt begotten into the world, he ſaith, And let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> Phil. 2.9, 10, 11, <hi>Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth. And that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord.</hi> Willingly or unwillingly, by conſent or by conſtraint, all ſhall bow to the Lord Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, to God in our nature, even to the Son of man.</p>
               <p n="6">6. What honour is it to our nature, that God in the humane nature ſhould diſpoſe of the eternal eſtates of men and Angels? for God ſhall even <hi>judg the world by the man</hi> Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. Joh. 5.27, <hi>And hath given him autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to execute judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, by Chriſts taking our nature upon him, not only our nature, but we our ſelves are honoured. 1. We have a nearer union with Chriſt than man in his innocency had with God; a nearer union than the Angels have; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers make up one body with Chriſt: he is the head, and they are the members, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18, <hi>And he is the head of the body the Church.</hi> Eph. 1.22, 23, <hi>And gave him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is his body.</hi> Heb. 2.11, <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are all one, for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them brethren.</hi> 2. We are not beholden to one of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not to the Angels, nor any other Creature; you are independent of them all; you have Salvation by one of your own nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16, 17, <hi>For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the ſins of the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us conſider how Chriſts taking our nature upon him, or taking it into the union of his Perſon, is the great
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58137:106"/>qualification of him for the Office of Mediatorſhip. Our Mediator behoved to be God manifeſted in the fleſh: to make way for clearing this, I ſhall premiſe, 1. That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Covenant (if any Covenant was made with the Angels, as ſome think) it was not made with the whole Angelical nature, it was perſonal, ſome of them fell, and ſome of them ſtood, and all fell not in them that fell. Mans firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was with his Nature, and in <hi>Adam</hi> all fell. 2. When Man and Angels fell, God intended to raiſe the one, and not to raiſe, but to deſtroy the other. 3. God will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore man without a fit ſatisfaction to his Juſtice. 4. There is an eternal impotency in man to give to God a fitting ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; the command of the Law man cannot obey; the curſe of the Law he cannot bear to his own advantage, ſo as to make way thereby to his own reſtitution. Here is obedience required that cannot be performed by man; and a guiltineſs contracted that cannot be taken away by man: Therefore a Mediator muſt be had, and he muſt be God and man in one perſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He muſt be God: for man could not make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God for ſin: It was the union of the Divine nature with the human, that made all Chriſts ſufferings meritorious, that made his ſhoulder fit for the burden and weight of the work of ſatisfying Divine Juſtice, Pſal. 89 19, <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty.</hi> I ſay therefore, that it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary our Mediator muſt be God, 1. Becauſe theſe evils which he was to expiate, could never be taken away by any perſon that was not God; ſin done againſt an Infinite Majeſty, muſt have an equal ſatisfaction. 2. Becauſe the things with which he was to wreſtle, and the Enemies which he was to ſubdue, could not be wreſtled with, nor ſubdued by any perſon who was not God. Could a meer man wreſtle with the infinite wrath of God? ſubdue Satan and Death? No, the only human nature of Chriſt, which in it ſelf is finite and mortal, could not bear up with that, except the perſon had been God. 3. Becauſe the good things which he was to purchaſe, could never have been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by any perſon who was not God, a happineſs far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Adam</hi>'s, eternal righteouſneſs, the image of God, and communion with him in glory: only the infinite worth of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58137:106"/>Chriſt the Son of God, could compaſs that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He muſt not be God only: for <hi>a Mediator is not a Mediator of one,</hi> but he muſt be God manifeſted in the fleſh. He muſt be man, 1. Becauſe his name is to be put in our Bond: he is to ſtand in our ſtead, and to put his Soul in our ſouls room; therefore he muſt be ſomething elſe than God: for God will have ſatisfaction to Juſtice, of man; <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die.</hi> 2. Our Mediator muſt be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of ſatisfaction: A Mediator of interceſſion may exalt grace and mercy by entreaties, but cannot ſatisfie Juſtice: this will not do the turn; the Debt muſt be payed, the principal Debt; to obey the command, he muſt be ſubject to the Law, and the forfeiture muſt be ſatisfied, he muſt bear the curſe and die; for without blood there is no remiſſion: he muſt then be a man, and muſt have a body and ſoul: the nature of Angels will not ſuffice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 9, <hi>A body haſt thou prepared me. Then ſaid he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God.</hi> 3. He muſt be one with us; elſe what he doth cannot be imputed to us; as there muſt be an imputation of our ſin to him, ſo of his righteouſneſs to us: now imputation imports an union; for union is the ground of imputation; and it muſt be an union in nature and Covenant; the Angels ſin was not imputed to man, but <hi>Adams</hi> was, with whom we were one in nature and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. 4. Our Mediator muſt receive the Spirit, without which we cannot be ſanctified, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19, <hi>And for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo might be ſanctified through the truth.</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>v.</hi> 35, <hi>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</hi> Now the Father cannot receive the graces of the Spirit, neither the Son as God: for unto that which is infinite, nothing can be added; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Mediator muſt have mans nature, which is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving that which our Mediator muſt have. 5. Our Mediator muſt convey to us the Adoption of ſons, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt receive it himſelf, and ſo become a man, that he may receive it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6, <hi>But when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons. And becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father.</hi> Chriſt is <hi>the</hi> natural <hi>Son</hi> of God,

Our Mediator muſt be ſuch a Perſon from whom we may receive the inheritance; he muſt therefore be man; for it is from Chriſt-man, as he is an <hi>heir appointed,</hi> Heb. 1.2, that we receive the inheritance; for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inheritance of Chriſt cannot be communicated, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5, 7, <hi>To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons.

Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, is appointed Mediator, and takes our nature upon him, that the order of the three perſons of the Godhead, and their working, might in this be manifeſted unto us: The Father is the firſt Perſon and Fountain of divine operation, he works by the Son, and the Father and the Son work by the Holy Ghoſt.

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Why muſt the Son of God be not only a man, but the Son of man, of the ſeed of the woman, of the ſame lump with us?

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He muſt be of the ſame lump with us, 1. The more to ſet forth his condeſcenſion, and our exaltation: in this his condeſcenſion was greater, in taking a nature of the ſame lump with us, than if he had taken our nature created, as <hi>Adams</hi> was; and the exaltation of our nature was the greater, that Chriſts fleſh was not only of the ſame kind, but of the ſame lump with ours. 2. That we might have the more comfort in his ſatisfaction: for if he had taken a created nature, that could have reached to a perſonal ſatisfaction only; but he takes our nature, and the fleſh of our nature, that he might ſatisfie for the ſin of our nature, and make a publick ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the ſins of many. The Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his nature, not perſonal; and his ſin alſo being of the ſame kind, the ſatisfaction muſt be in the ſame nature, and by one of the ſame lump, and not with a perſon having that kind of nature, but not the ſame nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 9, <hi>Foraſmuch then as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>raw as near to us in reſpect of his human nature, as to God in reſpect of the Divine nature: he muſt be a man, and a man of the ſame lump that his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are of; a Prieſt <hi>ordained for men,</hi> and <hi>taken from among men,</hi> Heb. 5.1. 4. That the alliance with us might be the ſtraiter, and his right of Redemption the ſtronger: for our Mediator behoved not only to be a Redeemer, but a <hi>Goel,</hi> one to whom belonged the right of Redemption. Now this could not be, except he were our own kinſman, our brother of the ſame lump and ſtock, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.5, 6, &amp;c. Chriſt came to raiſe up ſeed to his dead kinſman, old <hi>Adam,</hi> who dyed without iſſue of grace (for ought that his ſeed had from him) therefore he behoved to be our brother and kinſman; and by this means Chriſt (1.) as the kinſman, not only may do it, but he takes it on him as his duty, <hi>v.</hi> 7, <hi>to perform the duty of a husbands brother:</hi> if the kinſman had refuſed, he is put to open ſhame, by taking off his ſhooe; which Chriſt will not let be done to him. 2. By this means the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance (even the better Inheritance than that of <hi>Adams</hi>) is ſetled upon our Family, Jer. 32.8, <hi>For the right of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is thine, and the Redemption is thine.</hi> 5. That he might ſanctifie our nature in the root, and repair it in the very foundation where <hi>Adam</hi> defiled it, when he and we have it of the ſame lump: Now you know it is the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> that <hi>ſanctifieth the lump,</hi> Rom. 11.16: for except he had been the firſt fruits of the ſame lump that we are of, the lump could not have been ſanctified by him, Heb. 2.11, <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one.</hi> Col. 1.15, <hi>The firſt-born of every creature.</hi> But in as much as he is the firſt fruits of the ſame lump with us, he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth our nature in the root, our conception, birth, nurſing, education, life, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Why did not the Son of God take upon him <hi>Adam</hi>'s nature in Innocency, when it was a virgin; but he took our nature upon him when it was at the worſt, when it was corrupted and accurſed?</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:58137:109"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It was not <hi>Adam</hi>'s nature in innocency that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Mediator, but ſinful nature; therefore he will take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him that nature that needed help, and will ſanctifie it by his taking of it upon him, Rom. 8.3, <hi>God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He did this to magnifie his love (as I have before ſhewed); there was the more wonderful love in it. There was, 1. Diſtinguiſhing love in it, that put difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and the Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16, <hi>For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> 2. There was condeſcending love in it, that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us at our worſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, <hi>But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us.</hi> Ezek. 16.8, <hi>Now when I paſſed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love, and I ſpread my skirt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, and covered thy nakedneſs; yea, I ſware unto thee, and entered into a Covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He did this, that he might be glorified in the greater deſtruction and confuſion of mans enemy, the Devil.</p>
               <p>Conſider, 1. The weaker that the enemy be, the greater is the confuſion of them that fall by him: how great is Satans confuſion, that by his power is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a world of men in a night, if he were permitted, when the man Chriſt in our nature, and having taken our nature upon him at the worſt, is the deſtruction of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil for ever? <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, <hi>Foraſmuch then as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devil.</hi> When by a <hi>babe</hi> and <hi>ſuckling</hi> the <hi>enemy</hi> and <hi>avenger is ſtilled,</hi> Pſal. 8.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For one to periſh in his own plot, is a great confuſion: when the Devil fell from Heaven, and could not reach An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to tempt them, he becomes mans enemy, and Chriſt deſtroys him in mans nature, in the ſimilitude of <hi>ſinful fleſh:</hi> he is twice defeated in his own plot, in our nature, 1. The Devil tempts man to ſin, and this proves his greateſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for out of mans fall came the bruiſing of his head:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58137:110"/>and it is obſervable, that in Satans ſentence is put the firſt promiſe of Chriſt to man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15, <hi>And I will put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed; it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel,</hi> Rom. 8.3. 2. When Chriſt is manifeſted in the fleſh, the Devil tempts men to kill him, and in this plot he is defeated again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, <hi>That he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devil.</hi> When he hath made innocent man become ſinful fleſh, he is deſtroyed in the <hi>ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of ſinful fleſh</hi> by the man Chriſt, who took our nature upon him when it was at the worſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a great confuſion for one to have his enemy to become his Judg, and to pronounce the ſentence againſt him, as his Judg: and hereby is Chriſt yet more glorified in the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mans enemy, the Devil; that the man Chriſt Jeſus in the ſimilitude of our fleſh, which he took upon him when it was at the worſt, hath judged the Devil, and ſhall judg men and Angels, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.11, <hi>Of judgment, becauſe the prince of this world is judged.</hi> Act. 17.31, <hi>Becauſe he hath appointed a day in the which he will judg the world in righteouſneſs by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Our Mediator behoved to partake of all our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3, <hi>A man of ſorrows:</hi> who is to leave us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſufferings, and therefore behoved to take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him when it was at the worſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, <hi>He endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.20, 21, <hi>But if when ye do well, and ſuffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable before God. For even hereunto were ye called, becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> He is a Mediator that is to be <hi>made perfect through ſufferings,</hi> Heb. 5.8, 9.

Why muſt our Mediator be born of <hi>the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> and when? was there any matter what prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives he had? might he not have been of any other ſtock, ſince he is to be the redeemer of man, both <hi>Jews</hi> and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That he might be known to be the promiſed Meſſias,

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Law might reach him as the ſinner <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally,</hi> as one that was <hi>made ſin for us:</hi> for if he had not been made under the Law, he had been without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of it, it could not have reached him, nor taken hold of him, as one who took our Law-place upon him, and ſo we ſhould not have been the better of him; the taking on of our nature, could not have profited us, except he had alſo taken on our condition, as we were ſinful men, liable to the ſentence of the Law, for the tranſgreſſion thereof, which is expreſſed <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5, by our being <hi>under the Law,</hi> that was our condition; and that he might take it on him, he is <hi>made under the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More particularly, 1. He was made under the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> under the whole Law. 1. Under the <hi>Directive</hi> part of it, which he fulfilled and eſtabliſhed; he ſatisfied that part of the Law, without breaking ſo much as one jot or tittle of it; and eſtabliſhed it to be a rule to all his, that by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereof they ſhould teſtifie their love to him, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15, <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judg, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58137:111"/>and roſe again.</hi> 2. He was made under the <hi>Forfeiture</hi> and <hi>penalty</hi> of the Law; which he fulfilled and aboliſhed; to wit, the Forfeiture which we had incurred, and by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture had brought our ſelves under the penalty of death therein contained, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14, <hi>Blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his croſs.</hi> And this he ſatisfied by his obedience, even to the ſuffering of death <hi>noſtra vice,</hi> in our ſtead or room; and ſo he ſatisfied the Law fully, and cancelled the ſentence thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was made under the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> Luk. 2.21, 22, 23, 24, <hi>And when eight days were accompliſhed, for the purification of the child, his name was called Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies fall under a threefold conſideration: 1. As they are <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and ſo he was made under them to ſanctifie them; for Chriſt needed not circumciſion nor baptiſm, but by him they are ſanctified. 2. As they are <hi>types,</hi> and ſo the whole Ceremonial Law was fulfilled in Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17, <hi>Which are a ſhadow of things to come, but the body is Chriſt.</hi> 3.

               </p>
               <p>He was then made under the Ceremonial Law, to fulfil and aboliſh it: for if Chriſt had not come and been under it, we had ſtill remained under the burden of it: but by his being a <hi>Jew,</hi> made under the Law, we enjoy theſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of freedom from that yoke which believers enjoy under the new Teſtament.</p>

As alſo he went out of the world in like manner, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11, <hi>This ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall come in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into heaven.</hi> Therefore alſo the Angels came down at his birth, to waken up men unto the obſervation of that miracle, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.13, 14, <hi>And ſuddenly there was with the Angels a multitude of the heavenly hoſt praiſing God, and ſaying, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> It is a ſign above nature, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a ſign, Behold, A virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name Immanuel.</hi> A matter that reaſon comprehendeth not; faith only deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it. 3. Becauſe Original ſin (at leaſt the ſtain and filth thereof) cometh to us by propagation; therefore he muſt not come into the world in the ordinary way, being that he muſt be <hi>ſeparated from ſinners,</hi> and be <hi>that holy thing</hi> upon which the corruption of our nature cannot fall, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. Being alſo conceived of the Holy-Ghoſt, to ſanctifie the ſeed of the woman, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35, <hi>And the Angel anſwered, and ſaid unto her, The Holy-Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the higheſt ſhall over-ſhadow thee, therefore alſo that Holy thing which ſhall be born of thee ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 7. Why is Chriſt made man in the fulneſs of time, and not ſooner nor later?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may ſatisfie and content us, that it is written, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.2, that was <hi>the time appointed of the Father.</hi> It liked him to appoint that time; yet for further ſatisfaction (if further be neceſſary or attainable),</p>
               <p>Conſider, 1. God will have the world to know their own condition, to try their own wiſdom, and he will give them time to do ſo, if the world can do any thing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to deliver the creature from vanity and bondage, unto which it was made ſubject by reaſon of corruption; and when the world in ſo long time might ſee that they could do nothing for their own happineſs and Redemption, then God will ſend his Son, and let out his wiſdom in Chriſt, that had been hid from the world ever ſince the fall, when
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58137:112"/>the Law of God written in mans heart was corrupted, and all things out of order; ſo that by the light of nature, and rules of virtue, no man could find out the way to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor diſcover any thing of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20, 21, <hi>Where is the wiſe? where is the ſcribe? where is the diſputer of this world? hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world? For after that in the wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God; it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. God will have his people to wait long, and to be much exerciſed, before he let out great mercies, and fulfil great promiſes to them. And ſo it is in this: If in the fulfilling of the promiſe of bringing <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed to <hi>Canaan,</hi> he would be ſo long waited on: If in the deſtruction of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt he will be ſo many years waited on, before he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil his promiſe; What wonder that he will be waited on for the promiſe of Chriſt longer, even till <hi>the fulneſs of time,</hi> this being the greateſt promiſe that ever he made to his people? He will have <hi>the conſolation of Iſrael waited for, and redemption in Jeruſalem looked for,</hi> Luke 2.25, 38.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed to ſpeak of Chriſts unction, and his qualifications for his Mediatorſhip refulting thence; let us firſt make ſome uſe of this union of the two natures in Chriſt, this great fundamental qualification of him for the Office of our Mediator, that he is God and Man; that for his due qualification he hath taken our fleſh into his perſon, therein to ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p>In the union of the two natures in the Perſon of our Mediator, 1. As it holds forth his condeſcending, who ſtooped to be made manifeſt in the fleſh, 1. Let us admire and wonder at his love: It was love that made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend; it hath been and will be the admiration of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13, 14, <hi>And ſuddenly there was with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel a multitude of the heavenly hoſt, praiſing God, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12, <hi>Which things the Angels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to look into.</hi> And how is it that we want affections and admirations? Beſide what I have before ſaid, theſe things wonderfully ſet out Chriſts love, 1. That he would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt our Redemption to Angels, but he would come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58137:112"/>and work it, Heb. 1.5, <hi>For unto which of the angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee?</hi> 2. That for the payment of our debt, and in order to his being in a capacity to do ſo, he would be in the ſame condition of clay with us, <hi>a worm and not a man,</hi> Pſal. 22.6. 3. That he would not buy us at a baſe ranſom, but at a great price, he would breathe out his life for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19, <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, but with the precious blood of Chriſt.</hi> 4. That he would condeſcend thus ſingularly to love man, to love him ſo, as that he loved not any other creature that ſinned againſt him. Heb. 2.16, <hi>For verily he took not on him the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of angels, but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let this raiſe up our hearts to thankfulneſs, when we think of Chriſts Incarnation, 1. This is the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of his readineſs to ſave ſinners: the principal errand Chriſt had unto the world, and in taking our nature, was to ſave ſinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.13, <hi>I am not come to call the righteous, but ſinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs to repentance.</hi> You may therefore be aſſured of his readineſs to receive ſuch when they come unto him. 2. This is the Fountain of all the promiſes of the Covenant of Grace: the three greateſt promiſes in all the Covenant flow from Chriſts Incarnation. <hi>I will be your God: I will give you my Son: and, I will give you my Spirit.</hi> All theſe, and all the reſt too, flow from this Fountain; for neither the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son, nor the Spirit are given to us, but through a Mediator, and through his aſſuming of our nature, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As the union of the two natures in our Mediator, holds out the exaltation of our nature; Hence, 1. Let us wonder <hi>what is man</hi> thus to be exalted: the eighth Pſalm is written for this end; that we may wonder at mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, not in Creation only, but in Redemption, as <hi>Verſ.</hi> 2, ſhews, which is applied to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.16, <hi>Out of the mouth of babes and ſucklings, thou haſt perfected praiſe:</hi> how ſhould this provoke to admiration, that in our nature the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead</hi> ſhould <hi>dwell bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9, 2. Let us take Chriſts coming in the fleſh, and the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58137:113"/>exalting of our nature, by the perſonal union with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, for a pledg of the fulfilling of all other promiſes, and granting all other mercies and ſalvation to us; the root and body of the promiſes is come, the branches will follow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20, <hi>For all the promiſes of God, in him are yea, and in him are Amen.</hi> Rom. 8.32, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> This pledg was uſed by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as a confirmation from God, and a ground of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance for delivering the Church from <hi>Aſhur, Iſa.</hi> 7.11, 14, <hi>Ask thee a ſign of the Lord thy God, ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.—Therefore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a ſign, Behold, A virgin ſhall conceive. and bare a Son, and ſhall call his name Immanuel.</hi> And ſhall we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt him for granting any other petition, or deliverance, who hath granted the main one? 3. Let us take boldneſs to come to God through Chriſts fleſh: the great Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier in Heaven is of our kindred; take courage, and improve the favour and friendſhip that our brother hath in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20, 21, 22, <hi>Having therefore, brethren, boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way which he hath conſecrated for us, through the vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh. And having an High-prieſt over the houſe of God, let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As the union of the two natures in our Mediator holds out his due qualification and fitneſs for his office: 1. Behold in him a general fitneſs to receive each Perſon, whoſe nature he beareth. I ſay, a fitneſs to receive them, even all ſorts of perſons without exception; there is none who needs him and cometh to him, needs to diſtruſt him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> 2. Let this encourage ſuch as are afraid to draw near to God for union and reconciliation with him, becauſe of their eſtrangement from him, through loſs of his Image: Lo, he is willing to unite himſelf to thee, and hath given aſſurance of it in his Son, by vertue of his union with our nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. 3. When we find diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to draw near to God, or languiſhing in the life of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58137:113"/>our faith toward God: Let us draw near to God, the fleſh of our our Mediator, for influences, and ſearn to come to God through the vail of his fleſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20. Jeſus Chriſt is not ſtrange, he is near to us, and his graces cannot be far off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 8, <hi>Say not in thine heart, Who ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into heaven? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the word of faith which we preach.</hi> But it is with many, and even with the moſt part, as with the ten Tribes, who pleaded kindred and blood to <hi>David,</hi> yet there were but two tribes that clave to him; and being nearer in kindred, would not be beaten from him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.16, 17. Some talk-luſtily, and bear themſelves boldly upon Chriſt in words; others are near of kin to him, and will not be beaten from him.</p>

               <p>THE ſecond part of Chriſts qualification for the Office of Mediatorſhip, is his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> this was conſequent unto his perſonal union; ſo that as we called the union of the two natures in Chriſt Perſon, the principal and chief qualification of him for this Office; ſo we are to look upon his Unction, as carrying in it divers qualifications which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from the former.</p>
               <p>The Unction of Chriſt comprehends two things; 1. The ſeparating of him unto theſe excellent Offices of being Prophet, Prieſt, and King of his Church. 2. The endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with the Spirit above meaſure, with gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, and aſſiſtances meet to enable him for the Work.</p>
               <p>The firſt Part of Chriſts Unction, is that whereby he is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58137:114"/>anointed to theſe Offices: Chriſt Mediator is anointed to be Prophet, Prieſt, and King of his Church. Concerning which we ſhall ſpeak: 1. Of the anointing. 2. Of the Offices. And firſt by this Unction, as it relateth to his Offices (for of his Unction, as it comprehends his Furniture, we are not now ſpeaking, but ſhall in the next place), we may underſtand according to the various uſe of anointing among men: and the Scripture purport of the Word. 1. His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation for theſe Offices in the Counſel of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, <hi>Behold, my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth.</hi> So the word is uſed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.13, of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> firſt Deſignation to ſucced in the Kingdom to <hi>Saul,</hi> long before he came to the Government. 2. The declaration of his being deſigned unto theſe Offices, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7, <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the decree, the Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> So anointing is taken in the caſe of Gods declaring <hi>Jehu</hi> ſucceſſor in the Kingdom, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.16, with 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.1. 3. The ſeparating of him, or ſetting him apart for theſe Offices, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.20, <hi>I have found David my ſervant, with my holy oyl have I anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</hi> So the word is uſed, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.22. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.17, with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.15. 4. The publick ſolemn inveſting him in theſe Offices, with power and authority to exerciſe them, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38, <hi>How God anointed Jeſus of Nazareth with the Holy-Ghoſt and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſſed of the Devil, for God was with him.</hi> Luk. 1.32, <hi>And the Lord God ſhall give unto him the throne of his father David.</hi> And its from his anointing that Chriſt hath his name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.41, <hi>We have found the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, which is, being interpreted, the Chriſt,</hi> Luk. 9.20. <hi>The Chriſt of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning theſe three Offices of Chriſt, we ſhall briefly touch upon, 1. The neceſſity of them in our Mediators Perſon. 2. The nature and uſe of them. 3. The harmony and conſent of theſe Offices in Chriſts perſon, and in his execution of them.</p>
               <p>And, 1. The neceſſity of theſe Offices in our Mediator, appeareth, 1. From the evils under which we were lying; man being under, 1. Ignorance of God. 2. Alienation from God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18, <hi>Having the underſtanding darkened,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58137:114"/>being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts.</hi> 3. Impotency to come unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which ſent me, draw him.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it was that our Mediator be a perſon that carrieth Offices, which may reach theſe evils. His prophecy and teaching meets with our ignorance of God, for he is <hi>a teacher come from God,</hi> Joh. 3.7. A Prophet by whom all his people are <hi>taught of God,</hi> Jer. 31.33. Iſa. 54.13. His Prieſthood and Sacrifice meets with our alienation and eſtrangement from God, for thereby the diſtance is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a friendſhip bound up with God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13, 14, 18, <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt. For he is our peace, who hath made both one. For through him we both have an acceſs by one ſpirit unto the Father.</hi> And his Kingdom meets with our impotency; for thereby we are mightily wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and determined, ſo as our impotency proves no over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering lett in the way of his grace, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, <hi>But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears from the work which he came to do, which required this conjunction of Offices in his Perſon: 1. He came to reveal a new way of happineſs, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to be a Prophet, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.37, <hi>A prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, of your brethren, like unto me, him ſhall you hear.</hi> Heb. 2.3, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord?</hi> 2. He came to purchaſe and acquire this new bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore behoved to be a Prieſt, to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the new Teſtament, that by means of death, for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tranſgreſſions of the firſt Teſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi> 3. He came to make application of his purchaſe, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved alſo to be a King, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9, <hi>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal ſalvation unt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:58137:115"/>2. The nature and uſe of theſe three Offices in our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, we find in ſome meaſure let out in the promiſes of the Covenant, at leaſt a chief and material hint at ſomething of all the three, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34, with <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. and 10. 1. Chriſt Mediator as a Prophet, travelleth in begetting a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding betwixt the two parties that are at variance, betwixt God and man; and to this effect, being intimately acquainted with all his Fathers ſecrets, 1. He publiſheth and declareth all the mind of God to his people, eſpecially in revealing the gracious purpoſe of God concerning the way and means of reconciliation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27, <hi>Neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him.</hi> Eph. 2.17, <hi>And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</hi> 2. He worketh the effectual knowledg of God, and of his will, in his peoples heart, See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, <hi>For God who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Luk. 1.77, 79, <hi>To give knowledg of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto his people, by the remiſſion of their ſins.—To give light to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, to guide our feet in the way of peace.</hi> 3. He removeth the miſtakes and prejudices whereby the alienation betwixt God and man is hightned and continued; and this by imparting the true mind of the parties to each other, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.21, <hi>If ſo be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jeſus.</hi> This is the nature and uſe of his prophetical Office, which he executeth by his word and ſpirit, cauſing light firſt to appear, and then to ſhine into the hearts of his people.</p>
               <p>The end of this Office, and his exerciſing it after this manner, is to promote his great deſign of reconciliation, which is the end of his Mediation; and this he doth, by declaring the mind of the parties to each other, removing miſtakes, which encreaſe alienation; begetting a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and thereby working a compliance betwixt the parties: and in reſpect of this Office mainly he is called a <hi>Prophet, Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22: and by way of eminency, <hi>the Prophet,</hi> and <hi>that Prophet,</hi> Joh. 6.14, and 7.40: and the <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Meſſenger of the Covenant,</hi> who publiſhed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed

               <p n="2">2. Chriſt Mediator in his Prieſthood travelleth, 1. About Satisfaction. 2. Interceſſion.

               <p n="1">1. I ſay, the nature and uſe of that Office relates to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for ſin, becauſe by virtue of that Office principally he performs the great work of ſatisfaction for our ſins, by offering up himſelf a ſacrifice to death, after he had given perfect obedience to the Law, Heb. 9.26, <hi>But now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi> And this he did as our Surety, he ſtood in the Elects room, and Juſtice did ſtrike him in their ſtead, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5, <hi>He was oppreſſed,</hi> &amp;c. or rather, according to the original, <hi>he was exacted, and anſwered;</hi> that is, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther required ſatisfaction for our ſins, and his Son (as our Surety) anſwered for us.</p>

               <p>Concerning the nature and parts of this Office, we ſhall only obſerve theſe three things; 1. That Chriſt Mediator did and doth both the parts of this Office on earth, and in Heaven, but with this difference, 1. On earth he eminently ſacrificed and offered up himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God.</hi> Yet he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7, <hi>Who in the days of his fleſh, when he had offered up prayers and ſuppl cations with ſtrong crying and tears unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard in that he ſeared.</hi> 2. In Heaven he eminently intercedes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7 25, <hi>Seeing he ever liveth to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for them.</hi> Chap. 9.24, <hi>But into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us:</hi> but he offereth up himſelf alſo, by preſenting the ſacrifice, and offering of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which was once made, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24, <hi>We are come,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things than that of Abel.</hi> 2. That all Chriſt's ſatisfaction and Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood would be ineffectual for our good, if he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the exerciſe of it by his interceſſion in Heaven, whereby he becometh the applying cauſe of ſalvation to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.10, 11, <hi>Called of God an High-prieſt after the order of Melchiſedec; of whom we have many things to ſay, and hard to be uttered, ſeeing ye are dull of hearing.</hi> Rom. 5.10, <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi> 3. That the deſign carried on by this Office is the ſame as in the former, to wit, Reconciliation, which is promoted through this Office, 1. By his giving ſatisfaction to Juſtice. 2. By his application of that ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and making Attonement for the ſins of his people.</p>
               <p>The nature and uſe of Chriſts Kingdom, I lay down in theſe Aſſertions: 1. That it is Diſpenſatory; Chriſt Mediator is a King appointed, a Viceroy and Deputy-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour in ſubordination to his Father. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Yet have
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58137:116"/>I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion.</hi> John 5.23, <hi>That all men ſhould honour the ſon even as they honour the father; he that honoureth not the ſon; honoureth not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſent him:</hi> a Kingdom which is to be rendered up again to him who gave it to him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, <hi>Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father, when he ſhall have put down all rule and all authority and power.</hi> His Kingdom as Mediator, is not <hi>regnum naturale,</hi> which he hath as God co-eſſential with his Father; but <hi>regnum oeconomicum,</hi> which he hath by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and unction from his Father. 2. That it is very large, yea univerſal; for it is <hi>all power in heaven and earth,</hi> Matth. 28.18: and it reacheth to the <hi>upholding all things by the word of his power,</hi> Heb. 1.3. It is over all the creatures, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, <hi>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church.</hi> Over all Mankind, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14, <hi>And there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations and languages ſhould ſerve him.</hi> Rev. 17.14, <hi>He is lord of lords, and king of kings.</hi> Over the Reprobate as well as the Elect, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110.1, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footſtool.</hi> Over all ages and generations of men: <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14, <hi>his dominion is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting dominion, which ſhall not paſs away; and his kingdom that which ſhall not be deſtroyed.</hi> Although it be more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, and he be a King more peculiarly to the Church and the elect World, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.6, 8, 9, <hi>Yet have I ſet my king upon my holy hill of Zion,—Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion: thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel.</hi> And that both outwardly, by appointing them Laws, Ordinances and Officers, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9.6, 7, <hi>For unto us a child is born, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a ſon is given, and the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder: and his name ſhall be called Wonderful Counſellour, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace; of the encreaſe of his government and peace there ſhall be no end; upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with juſtice and with judgment from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth and for ever.</hi> And inwardly by ruling in their hearts.

In the kingdom of Chriſt Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, he doth all things with authority and power, and yet it is wholly ruled by his Word and Spirit. He doth all things in his Kingdom, not by outward ſecular force, but by his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58137:117"/>influences upon the ſpirits of men, and determining them in a ſecret way, whether providentially, or by ſaving and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying influences. <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.6, <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my ſpirit, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Pſalm 110.1, 2, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footſtool. The Lord ſhall ſend the rod of thy ſtrength out of Zion: rule thou in the midſt of thine enemies.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.8, <hi>And then ſhall that wicked be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming.</hi> 6. The great work of his Kingly Power is to imploy it for ſaving of his people, and ſubduing his and their enemies, to bring to paſs his purpoſe of the one and the other, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or againſt all-contradiction, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110 throughout, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2 throughout. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10, <hi>Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.</hi> 7. The great and ſpecial end of Chriſts Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is to make his other Offices effectual for the ſaving of his Elect, to ſupport his Prieſthood and Prophecy, and to give vigour and efficacy to them: for except Chriſt had been a Prince that had power over his friends and foes, his other Offices could never have been made effectual to the Elect, nor he a <hi>Captain of Salvation</hi> to them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. Therefore alſo he is ſet forth as a Prieſt upon a Throne, who carrieth all things as a King with power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3, <hi>When he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſat down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high.</hi> It is his Kingdom which effects that Reconciliation which is the end of a Mediator, that which his Prophecy teacheth, and his Prieſthood and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice hath purchaſed; he ſits as a King, and conveys the power of it into the ſoul. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, <hi>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, and caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledg of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The Harmony and Conſent of theſe three Offices in our Mediator, and how they do concurr for the end of his
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58137:118"/>Mediatorſhip, to wit, the trieſting of the difference betwixt God and man, by making a reconciliation, and binding up friendſhip by a new Covenant. Here obſerve the ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the three Offices in the Mediator Chriſt. 1. All theſe Offices level at one end, to wit, <hi>Reconciliation</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> which is the great buſineſs wherefore a Mediator was appointed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf:</hi> but with this difference, his Prophecy teaches the way of Reconciliation, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, <hi>Him ſhall ye hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you.</hi> His Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood opened the way, and purchaſed the peace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, 15, <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God. And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the new Teſtament, that by means of death for the redemption of the Tranſgreſſors that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi> His Kingdom doth effect and do the buſineſs, <hi>John</hi> 12.32, <hi>And I, if I be lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi> Col. 1.20, 21, <hi>And having made peace through the blood of his croſs, by him to reconcile all things to himſelf, I ſay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. And you that were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled.</hi> But yet we muſt not conceive the actings of theſe Offices in Chriſt ſeparately, nor appropriate to any of them ſolely the effecting Reconciliation or Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but underſtand it by way of eminency, and ſo of the following particulars. 2. Theſe three Offices in our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, concur to do the ſame work, but in divers ways, that our Reconciliation and Salvation might be the more compleat and ſure: he would have us ſaved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, <hi>to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt;</hi>

Chriſt as Prieſt through his death reconcileth us to God, and ſaveth us (as captives are redeemed) by Ranſom and Price. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12, <hi>But this man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:58137:118"/>for ever ſat down on the right hand of God.</hi> Col. 1.1, 20, <hi>And having made peace through the blood of his croſs, by him to reconcile all things to himſelf.</hi> Rom. 5.10, <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Chriſt as King, by his Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion effectuates our Salvation by power and conqueſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, <hi>That through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devil.</hi> Eph. 4.8, <hi>Wherefore he ſaith when he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> 3. Chriſt as Prophet effectuates our reconciliation with God, and Salvation, by our own conſent: informing our judgments, begetting a good underſtanding betwixt God and us; removing miſtakes, and making us willing to be reconciled unto him, and ſaved by him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2, 3, <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend the rod of thy ſtrength out of Zion,—Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power: in the beauties of holineſs, from the womb of the morning, thou haſt the dew of thy youth.</hi> This he effects by Treaty, till he hath concluded favour and friendſhip betwixt the parties by voluntary conſent in a Covenant, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17, <hi>And the Spirit, and the Bride ſay, Come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Offices in our Mediator ſweetly concur toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to meet with three great Evils in our natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which are comprehenſive of all our miſery), and to deal in taking them away: 1. Chriſt as a Prophet dealeth with our Ignorance of God, and blindneſs: and removeth that, by applying himſelf to us in the exerciſe of that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Office, Eph. 4.18, 21, <hi>Having the underſtanding dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their heart—If ſo be that ye have heard him, and been taught by him, as the truth is in Jeſus.</hi> 2. Chriſt as Prieſt, with his Atonement and Satisfaction, dealeth with our alienation and eſtrangement from God, and our enmity againſt him, which is the fruit of our Ignorance of him; and by making a ſatisfaction to of fended Juſtice, he takes away the enmity. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10, <hi>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> Col. 1.21, <hi>And you that were ſometimes alienated, and enemies in your mind by
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58137:119"/>wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled.</hi> 3. Chriſt as a King dealeth with our Impotency and Rebellion, which is the third great evil in our unnatural condition, which he ſweetly ſubdueth by the power and dominion of his grace, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45.5, <hi>Thine arrows are ſharp in the heart of the kings enemies, whereby the people fall under thee.</hi> Rev. 6.2, <hi>And he went forth conquering and to conquer.</hi> Or the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of theſe Offices may be conceived thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt as a Prophet dealeth eminently with the underſtandings of men, to perſwade and convince them by his teaching, 2 Cor. 4.4, 6, <hi>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine in them—for God, who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt as a Prieſt, as a merciful, loving, condeſcending man, who hath laid down his life for us, uſeth entreaties, and dealeth with the affections mainly, when the judgment is informed by his propheſie and teaching, 2 Cor. 5.20, <hi>Now then we are ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt as King dealeth with the wills of men, the proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and higheſt enemy that Chriſt hath in our nature, which he ſubdues and overpowers by determinating grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3, <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe three Offices in our Mediator, do moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly conſpire in aiding and ſupporting one another, that each Office may be vigorous and effectual for the end of his Mediation. And here conſider, 1. How the prophecy of Chriſt is aiding to his Prieſthood and Kingdom: 1. By teaching what the Prieſthood and Kingdom of Chriſt are, and the way how reconciliation and peace is to be made: His prophecy teaches thoſe myſteries of the Kingdom, and our ſalvation, which otherways we could not know, Joh. 1.18, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time: the only begotten Son which is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> It ſheweth, 1. Where a Sacrifice is to be had, and a power to make out our peace, which upon the matter is the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Kingdom of Chriſt, Acts 5.31, <hi>Him hath God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58137:119"/>with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.27, <hi>And ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lye.</hi> 2. How to apply Chriſts Prieſthood at firſt for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and how to apply it daily and continually for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated pardon and forgiveneſs, and how to improve it as our daily ſacrifice, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> And 2.1, 2. <hi>My little children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not: and if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous,</hi> &amp;c. 3. How to live by faith, to depend upon Chriſt, and to be guided continually by him, as the ruler of his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38, <hi>Now the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> Pſal. 73.24, <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel, and afterward receive me to glory.</hi> 2. By removing miſtakes and prejudices, which are ſo rooted in our hearts, that there can be no agreement till theſe prejudices be taken off, and a good underſtanding be gotten betwixt the parties: Thus Chriſt played the Prophet to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> by inſtructing her, till he had removed her miſtakes and prejudices, and informed her judgment right, and then he had acceſs to deal further with her, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.3, By convincing of the need of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Sacrifice, and of his Kingdom; he doth teach his people as a Prophet, till they know they need a Sacrifice, and till he ſhew them where it is; and till they know they need a King and the arm of Omnipotency, for effecting a change of the Covenant-ſtate, <hi>John</hi> 16.8, <hi>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Job 33.23, <hi>If there be a meſſenger with him, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, one among a thouſand, to ſhew unto man his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider, 2. How the Prieſthood of Chriſt concurreth with his Propheſie and Kingdom, and is aiding to them: 1. His Prieſthood is aiding to his Propheſie, 1. By making God acceſſible through the new and living way of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, taught by his Propheſie; God having now accepted a ſacrifice: and we having a Prieſt, by whom we may come to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20, <hi>Having therefore brethren, boldneſs to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58137:120"/>enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way which he hath conſecrated for us through the vail, that is to ſay, the fleſh:</hi> and an Advocate and Interceſſor to pray for us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2, <hi>We have an Advocate with the father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous; and he is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins.</hi> 2. By making that great Prophet more affable and condeſcending to us, by how much he is come near to us in our nature; and hath taken his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from among his brethren; I mean, his fleſh and body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren.</hi> Chap. 5.1, <hi>For every High-prieſt taken from among men, is ordained for men in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, that they may offer both gifts and ſacrifices for ſins.</hi> Chap. 10. v. 5, <hi>Whererefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith, ſacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> 2. His Prieſthood is aiding to his Kingdom, and that in both the parts of it: 1. In his ſacrifice and ſatisfaction, he hath doubled his right and title to his people, and worketh their ſalvation by price; which as a King he doth by power and conqueſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that by means of death for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19, <hi>Foraſmuch as ye know that ye were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with corruptible things,—but with the precious blood of Chriſt.</hi> 2. In his Interceſſion, he carrieth the ſame buſineſs of our Salvation by favour and entreaty, which he hath alſo carried by Command as a King, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> With 1.3, <hi>When he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſat down on the right hand of the majeſty on high.</hi> John 17.24, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi>
               </p>

There muſt be a wonderful fulneſs of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which proceedeth from a perſon thus anointed. 2.

He hath treaſured up all his Churches happineſs in Chriſt, that he ſhould be to them whatſoever they need: and that he ſhould carry all Offices whereof they can have uſe. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19, <hi>For it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi> 4. From the well-ſpring of his Unction, he hath made another Unction to flow to us, for calling us to high and honourable things, and furniſhing us for them; <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. <hi>And hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God, and his Father.</hi> 1 John 2.27, <hi>But the anointing which you have received of him, abideth in you: and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lye: and even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9, <hi>For ye are a choſen generation, a royal Prieſthood, a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nation, a peculiar people, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called you out of darkneſs unto his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us make uſe of Chriſt Mediator in all his Offices, and acknowledg him in them all, and take notice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of theſe for effecting our happineſs. And for this effect, 1. Let us ſtudy to be acquainted with our need of Chriſt in all his Offices: Some men know not their need of a Prieſt, but very few know their need of a Teacher: they think they are very knowing, while they are blind; but far
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58137:121"/>fewer know their need of a King; they think they can rule themſelves. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9, <hi>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, ſin revived, and I died.</hi> And yet our need of all theſe is ſuch, that we could not have been compleatly ſaved, if any of theſe Offices had been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Mediator: we ſtand in need of a Prophet, a Prieſt, and a King.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Study to know, and be convinced, that there is in us a natural enmity againſt all theſe Offices of Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: 1. Enmity againſt him as a Prophet, againſt his Teaching and his Truth; diſliking his truths which croſs our luſts, <hi>John</hi> 6.60, <hi>Many therefore of his Diſciples when they had heard this, ſaid, This is an hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> Quenching and reſiſting the voice and teaching of his Spirit. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10, <hi>But they rebelled and vexed his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> 2. Enmity againſt him as a Prieſt, by undervaluing his Perſon, Suffering, Satisfaction, Righteouſneſs, Merits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3, <hi>For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves unto the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> 3. Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him as a King; againſt his ſpiritual Worſhip, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Wages: a principle which controuls them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, <hi>But I ſee another law in my members warring againſt the law of my mind, bringing me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivity to the law of ſin, which is in my members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt take with our need of Chriſt in theſe his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and lay down our enmity againſt them; that is, in the knowledg that we need not only a Prieſt, but a Prophet, and a King; we muſt break off our rebellions againſt theſe his Offices, and lay down the weapons whereby we have oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, which are mainly ſelf-conceit, and knowledg, or <hi>Science, faſly ſo called,</hi> oppoſing him as a Prophet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2, <hi>And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing yet as he ought to know:</hi> and ſelf-will, oppoſing his Kingdom, refuſing to admit of his Laws within us, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.14, <hi>We will not have this man to rule over us:</hi> and ſelf-worth, or righteouſneſs, oppoſing his Prieſthood, by ſetting up ſomething in the place of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3, <hi>For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:58137:122"/>4. Let us by all means take heed that the grace of God tendred to us through a Mediator in all theſe Offices, be not in vain, through our not ſeeking to it, and laying hold on it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, 2, <hi>Let us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his Reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it. For unto us was the Goſpel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi> A Court of Juſtice is a publick Sanctuary; but it actually relieveth none but thoſe that ſeek unto it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18, <hi>We might have a ſtrong conſolation who have ſled for refuge, to lay hold on the hope ſet before us.</hi> It is in vain as to our profit, that Chriſt carrieth theſe Offices, if we do not make application to him for his Teaching, his Sacrifice, and his Government, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21, <hi>Do not fruſtrate the grace of God: for if righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1, 9, <hi>We beſeech you alſo, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us have our hearts jointly and equally ſatisfied to receive him in all his Offices, and not to divide his compleat Unction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4, <hi>Behold, I have given him for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the people, a leader and commander to the people.</hi> Acts 5.31, <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Iſrael, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins.</hi> Jer. 31.33, 34, <hi>But this ſhall be the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, ſaying, Know the Lord: for all ſhall know me from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification and redemption.</hi> There be who divide his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, who would be ſaved by his Prieſthood, but will neither be taught by his Prophecy, nor ruled by his Kingdom. 2. Others, who would be both ſaved and taught, but not commanded by him. Again, There be who would divide the things belonging to his Offices: As 1. who would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58137:122"/>to his teaching by outward Ordinances, but will not ſubmit themſelves to the inward teaching of his Spirit. 2. Who will be content to take his ſatisfaction, and merit of his death, but think they need not his interceſſion. 3. Who would take the protection of his Kingdom, but will not have the Laws and Government thereof. 4. Who would be made happy by his means, but will not be made holy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let us labour to ſeek within us the experiment of the virtue of each of his Offices, and of the ſeveral parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and things pertaining to the ſame.</p>
               <p>And 1. of his Prophecy; and that not only of his doing the part of a Prophet, in ſhewing to us things more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, but things more bitter alſo, even our ſin, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, Joh. 16.8, <hi>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of ſin, and of righteouſneſs, and of judgment.</hi> Pſal. 50.21, <hi>But I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us ſtudy to experience the power and efficacy of his Prieſthood in both parts thereof, of his Satisfaction, and of his Interceſſion; of the death and life of our Prieſt, and that to all the intents of theſe parts of that Office, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, for acceſs to God, for bringing you in favour, for keeping you in favour, for perſeverance, for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for holineſs, and for ſalvation, Rom. 5.9, 10, <hi>Much more then being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi> Heb. 4.14, <hi>Seeing then that we have a great High-Prieſt that is paſſed into the heavens, Jeſus the Son of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion.</hi> And 10.22, <hi>Let us draw near, in the full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> Acts 5.31, <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> Heb. 9.15, <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, that by means of death for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they

               <p>THE Second Part of Chriſt's Unction (which is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to his perſonal union) is the furniſhing and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him with ſpecial Requiſites and Furniture for the work of Mediation; and particularly, he is anointed with requiſite qualifications for the diſcharge of theſe three high Offices unto which he was deſigned, to be a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet to his Church: And this alſo is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>Anointing</hi> from which our Mediator has his name, <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1.41. Luke 9.20.</p>
               <p>Of this part of his Unction we ſhall ſpeak, 1. More ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, laying open what it is, and the comprehenſive phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Scripture which ſpeak of it. 2. More particularly, pointing at the ſpecial graces which were required, and were found eminently in our Mediator.</p>
               <p>And 1. of his Unction in general, whereby the Godhead made the Manhead full of himſelf, and of all the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable graces and gifts of the Spirit, to fit him for the work of a Mediator.</p>
               <p>The Scripture-phraſes concerning this unction, or fitneſs and furniture of Chriſt for his Mediatorſhip, are exceeding large and comprehenſive, Pſal. 45.2, 7, <hi>Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips—thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows.</hi> There his unction with the Holy Ghoſt, and graces of the Spirit, compared to <hi>oyl</hi> (which in regard of its <hi>nature</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth and maketh fit for uſe; and in regard of its <hi>uſe,</hi> was imployed for figuring and ſignifying mens fitneſs for the calling), is extolled comparatively, comparing it with the unction of believers; a large effuſion of the Spirit was upon him after an extraordinary meaſure and manner, <hi>John</hi> 3.34, <hi>For God giveth not the ſpirit by meaſure unto him:</hi> how then?
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58137:124"/>without meaſure: <hi>i.e.</hi> moſt abundantly: the like phraſe ſee Ezra 7.22, <hi>And ſalt, without preſcribing how much.</hi> Chriſt did receive the gifts of the Spirit in ſuch abundant meaſure, that he might have an overflowing meaſure in him, that ſhould run over, and fill all his members, Joh. 1.14, 16, <hi>full of grace and truth. And of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.27, <hi>But the anointing that ye have received of him, abideth in you: and ye need not that any man teach you,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 4.7, <hi>But unto every one of us is given grace, according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> And 1.23, <hi>The fulneſs of him that filleth all in all.</hi> Acts 10.38, He is ſaid to be <hi>anointed with the holy Ghoſt and with power,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, given to him, both might and authority, Mat. 28.18, <hi>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</hi> Joh. 17.2, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24, <hi>Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdom of God.</hi> And Col. 1.19, <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell:</hi> that is, admirable perfection of Grace; he hath all worth in his perſon, nothing is wanting in him that may compleat his peoples happineſs: ſome ſhort view of the Graces wherewith he was filled, we have <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2, 3, 4, 5, <hi>And the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſdom and underſtanding, the ſpirit of counſel and might, the ſpirit of knowledg, and of the fear of the Lord: And ſhall make him of quick underſtanding in the fear of the Lord: and he ſhall not judg after the ſight of his eyes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall reprove after the hearing of his ears: But with righteouſneſs ſhall he judg the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he ſhall ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips ſhall he ſlay the wicked. And righteouſneſs ſhall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulneſs the girdle of his reins.</hi> Rom. 15.12, <hi>And again Eſaias ſaith, There ſhall be a root of Jeſſe; and he that ſhall riſe to reign over the Gentiles, in him ſhall the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles truſt. And</hi> Col. 2.3, <hi>All the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;</hi> not <hi>abſolutely</hi> taken for infinite knowledg, as the words relate to the human nature of Chriſt; but <hi>relatively,</hi> for a marvellous height of perfection of theſe things, ſuch as was requiſite for his Mediatorſhip in order to our ſalvation. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9, it's ſaid of him, <hi>The fulneſs of the Godhead
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58137:124"/>dwells in him bodily,</hi> i. e. <hi>perſonally,</hi> by the union of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature with the human, in the unity of his perſon, the perfect Deity of the Son, with all his Attributes (and not only in regard of particular gifts and graces, as he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the Prophets and Saints), but as the ſoul dwelleth in the body, perſonally, or <hi>ſubſtantially,</hi> in oppoſition to the ſhadows of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>But mainly, by the anointing of Chriſt with the Holy Ghoſt, we underſtand two things, which we find joined with the Spirit promiſed to him: 1. All the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit in copious and abundant meaſure, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the higheſt pitch and degree that the human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt was capable to receive; and ſo the Spirit put upon him, is joined with the variety and eminency of excel-cellent gifts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2, &amp;c. 2. The unutterable aſſiſtance and preſence of the Spirit, bearing his Human nature up in all that he was to do as Mediator, that he ſhould not ſerve on his own charges: See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 2, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I have choſen: mine elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth. I have put my ſpirit upon him: he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles: He ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreet,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 89.21, <hi>With whom my hand ſhall be eſtabliſhed: mine arm alſo ſhall ſtrengthen him.</hi> And both theſe the holy Human nature of Chriſt needed, for theſe reaſons: 1. For the things which he was to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: If Chriſt had nothing to do but active obedience, the ſpirit of <hi>Adam,</hi> or confirmed Angels, might have done his turn: but he had another work to do (which would have cruſhed thoſe excellent creatures) to ſatisfie juſtice, and lye under the infinite wrath of God, and therefore needed more than they received, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, He is ſaid to have offered up himſelf, <hi>by the power of the eternal ſpirit,</hi> which I take to ſignifie, not only the Godhead which gave value to his ſuffering, but the aſſiſtance of the Holy-Ghoſt, whereby he was marvellouſly helped (I mean his humane nature) to go through thoſe ſufferings. 2. Becauſe his anointing was intended to run over to his people, and the off-fallings of it was deſigned to fill them; therefore it behoved to be without meaſure; ſuch a meaſure as cannot be comprehended by any other creature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16, <hi>Of his fulneſs do we receive.</hi> Pſal. 133.2,

                  <hi>It is like the precious oyntment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aarons beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments.</hi> Pſal. 68.18, <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high, thou haſt led captivity captive, thou haſt received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord might dwell among them:</hi> with Eph. 4.8, <hi>He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> Joh. 5.26, <hi>For as the Father hath life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf.</hi> 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath ſo contrived the buſineſs of Grace, that no created thing can act without the ſpirit: not <hi>Adam,</hi> not the Angels, not the holy humane nature of Chriſt; that all creatures might be known to have no ſelf-ſufficiency, but to be very depending things upon God, and upon grace, the aſſiſting-grace of his Spirit, that framed them, and gave them being, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15, <hi>And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid unto him, Suffer it to be ſo now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteouſneſs.</hi> Rom. 11.36, <hi>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a further clearing of this part of Chriſts Unction, I lay down theſe four Poſitions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the Nature thereof, that it was the ſame with the Unction of believers; it was not one ſpirit which Chriſt received, and another which believers receive: grace in him, and in them, differ not in kind, but in degrees: See <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14, 16, <hi>And the word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. And of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi> Pſal. 45.7, <hi>Thy God hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</hi> Gal. 4.6, <hi>And becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father.</hi> Rom. 8.9, 11, <hi>But ye are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, if ſo be that the ſpirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.—But if the ſpirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your mortal bodies, by his ſpirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> For, Conſider the Unction of the humane Nature of Chriſt, 1. It was Created-grace wherewith he was anointed: it was grace <hi>given</hi> upon the one part, and <hi>received</hi> upon the other:
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58137:125"/>it was grace-poured out and infuſed in the ſame manner as believers receive grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18, <hi>Thou haſt received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord might dwell among them.</hi> Pſal. 45.2, 7, <hi>Grace is poured into thy lips, therefore hath God bleſſed thee for ever. Thou loveſt righteouſneſs, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wickedneſs, therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows.</hi> 2. It was grace, which being finite, did receive encreaſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.40, 52, <hi>And the child grew, and waxed ſtrong in ſpirit, filled with wiſdom, and the grace of God was upon him. And Jeſus encreaſed in wiſdom and ſtature, and in favour with God and man;</hi> as all his members do, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13, <hi>Till all we come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledg of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> 3. It muſt needs be of the ſame kind, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our grace and Unction is part of his fulneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16, <hi>And of his fulneſs have all we received and grace for grace.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.20, 27, <hi>But ye have an unction from the holy one.—But the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which you have received of him, abideth in you.</hi> Yet ſo, as Chriſt is not degraded from his Soveraignty by his partners ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18, <hi>And he is the head of the body, the Church; who is the beginning, the firſt-born from the dead, that in all things he might have the preheminence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the meaſure of Chriſts Unction: although his Unction differ not in kind from the Unction of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; yet the meaſure of it ſo far exceeds our meaſure, that in reſpect thereof it is without meaſure, and yet the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of Chriſt had not infinite grace; for thereof it was not capable: it is as the Ocean compared with the drop of a Bucket; the ſpirit and grace was in him as water in the Fountain; in us, as water in the Ciſtern; communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in regard of Chriſt, is full and immediate; grace is in him as the money in the treaſure, which is disburſed to us according to our need; grace is in him as life and ſenſe is eminently in the heart and head, which is diffuſed into his members, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26, <hi>For as the Father hath life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf.</hi> Chap. 6. <hi>v.</hi> 57, <hi>As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father: ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi> Pſal. 45.2, 7, <hi>Thou art fairer than the children of men, grace is poured into thy lips.—God, thy God, hath anointed thee with
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58137:126"/>the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows.</hi> Col. 1.18, <hi>And he is the head of the body, the Church, who is the beginning, the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born from the dead, that in all things he might have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning the time of Chriſts Unction: whether he received the ſpirit without meaſure, in that copious abundant effuſion, from the womb, and firſt moment of his conception: We ſay he was anointed even from the firſt union of his two Natures in his perſon; the Godhead did ſanctifie the huname Nature, and make it holy, undefiled; and infuſed all graces, as appears from <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35, <hi>Therfore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> Heb. 7.26, <hi>For ſuch an High-prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher than the heaven.</hi> And from the glorious effects thereof, which did early appear in him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.42, to 49. Yet ſo, as he did more fully receive the anointing, and the ſpirit without meaſure, when he was to appear publickly, in the entire executing of his Offices, which was <hi>about the thirtieth year of his age;</hi> Luk. 3.23, with 4.1, 22, <hi>And Jeſus being full of the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>And all bare him witneſs, and wondred at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.</hi> Which was typified in <hi>Davids</hi> being twice anointed, once when he was firſt deſigned King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.13. And again, when he was inveſted in the preſence of the people, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.4. Which was alſo held forth in the viſible ſign of the Holy-Ghoſt, his deſcending upon him at his baptiſm, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16. And was intimated to <hi>John</hi> before-hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.33, 34, <hi>And I knew him not: but he that ſent me to baptize with water, the ſame ſaid unto me, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom thou ſhalt ſee the ſpirit deſcending and remaining on him, the ſame is he which bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth with the Holy-Ghoſt. And I ſaw, and bare record, that this is the Son of God,</hi> i.e. That he who as man ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſpirit, ſhould alſo as God, yea, as Mediator, give the ſpirit to others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Concerning the extent of his Unction, as it reacheth unto all the parts of his Mediatorſhip, and the furniſhing him for them. 1. He was anointed to be a Prophet, furniſhed with a dexterity to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18, 19, 22, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58137:126"/>to preach the Goſpel to the poor, he hath ſent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of ſight to the blind: to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed: to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.—And all bare him witneſs, and wondred at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.</hi> Iſa. 50.4, <hi>The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I ſhould know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary.</hi> Mat. 7.28, 29, <hi>And it came to paſs when Jeſus had ended theſe ſayings, the people were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine. For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the Scribes.</hi> Joh. 6.63, <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you, they are ſpirit, and they are life.</hi> Yea, he was not only furniſhed with a ſpirit for that calling, but alſo for prompting others, and fitting them for it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8, 11, <hi>And gave gifts unto men.—And he gave ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and ſome Teachers.</hi> 2. He was anointed (not only called, but furniſhed) for his Prieſtly Office, for both the parts thereof furniſhed by the Spirit, wherewith he was anointed, both for offering his Sacrifice, and for making his interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, <hi>Who through the eternal ſpirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God.</hi> Chap. 5. <hi>v.</hi> 7, <hi>Who in the days of his fleſh, when he had offered up prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and tears,</hi> &amp;c. 3. He was anointed, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for his Kingly Office, with a ſpirit, and gifts for Government; for conquering his enemies, and for ruling his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.3, 4, 5, <hi>Gird thy ſword upon thy thigh, O moſt Mighty, with thy glory and thy Majeſty. And in thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ride proſperouſly, becauſe of truth, and meekneſs, and righteouſneſs: and thy right hand ſhall teach thee terrible things. Thine arrows are ſharp in the heart of the kings enemies, whereby the people fall under thee.</hi> Iſa. 11.2, <hi>And the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the ſpirit of counſel and might, the ſpirit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and of the fear of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Behold, how well furniſhed our Mediator is ſet out for his work: there is a fulneſs in him to meet with all our emptineſs; yea, his fulneſs was given to him for this very end, that ſinners which cannot come where the fulneſs of God lieth, to receive from him immediately, may receive it out of Chriſts fulneſs.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:58137:127"/>
               <p>Conſider then, I ſay, 1. What a fulneſs is in him, what a running-over Unction he received; this is a work above us, and matter beyond our expreſſion, wherein we may more eaſily loſe our ſelves, even in this depth, than expreſs our ſelves: by this Unction he is full of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9, <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi> Full of the ſpirit, the Holy-Ghoſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.1, <hi>And Jeſus being full of the Holy-Ghoſt, full of grace and truth.</hi> Joh. 11.4, Full of light and of life. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4, <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men,</hi> &amp;c. Full of ſaving grace, and ſanctified gifts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2, <hi>And the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider for what end all this fulneſs was given unto him: he was full of the ſpirit, that he might fill us with his ſpirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7, <hi>Nevertheleſs I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you.</hi> Eph. 3.19, <hi>That ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> He was full of grace, that we might <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of his fulneſs,</hi> Joh. 1.16. That his Unction might run down upon us, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27, <hi>But the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you. That his grace might work mightily in us,</hi> Col. 1. laſt. He received gifts for our uſe, to give them to men, to the worſt of men, even <hi>to the rebellious,</hi> gifts to be meaſured out again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18, with <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Let his fulneſs and compleat Unction be improved, 1. For convincing ſuch as continue ſo empty, when Chriſt is ſo full? Ah, that we ſhould be ſo poor, when Chriſt is ſo rich! when we have ſo full an anointed one, that we ſhould never taſte of his Unction! ſome have nothing, and ſome have little; but very few are filled with the fulneſs of Chriſt, and made to run over-with his Unction: the fault is in us that he is ſo wet, and we are ſo dry, <hi>John</hi> 5.40, <hi>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For alluring and gaining the hearts of empty creatures. Things allure, as there is much of precious furniture in them: but this is ſad, when God hath anointed Chriſt with the Spirit above meaſure: that empty creatures care nothing for
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58137:127"/>him, that his fulneſs and furniture is propounded and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered every day in the Goſpel, and we are not allured by it. <hi>Song.</hi> 1.3, <hi>Becauſe of the ſavour of thy good ointments, thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore the virgins love thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For comforting believers: all this fulneſs of the Spirit, of gifts and graces wherewith Chriſt was anointed, it is yours: it was not only for your uſe, but it is your proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23, <hi>All are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods:</hi> You may uſe it as your own; you may come to the Fountain, to the Treaſure, to the ſtore-houſe of Chriſts fulneſs, when-you will: you may comfortably and confidently hold up your Ciſterns, till they be filled and run over, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.3, <hi>Therefore with joy ſhall ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation.</hi> Phil. 4.18, 19, <hi>But I have all, and abound: I am full—But my God ſhall ſupply all your need, according to his riches in glory by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Requiſites in a Mediator, which are eminently to be found in Chriſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Covenant.</head>
               <p>IN the next place, I come to ſpeak more particularly of this part of Chriſts Unction, or his Furniture for the work of Mediatorſhip, by laying open the Requiſites in a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which are all eminently to be found in Chriſt, and may be reckoned as ſo many properties or qualifications in the Mediator of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p>The Requiſites in a Mediator or Reconciler, that dealeth betwixt two parties, are of two ſorts: 1. Some Requiſites which more directly relate to the qualifying a perſon for ſuch an Employment. 2. There be other Requiſites which look more directly to the managing of that truſt: both the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58137:128"/>one and the other are eminently to be found in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And 1. Of the Requiſites fitting a Perſon for this truſt: 1. A Mediator muſt be ſuch a Perſon that hath <hi>Intereſt</hi> in both the parties, elſe he ſhould be ſuſpected either by one party or other: yea, his interpoſing ſhould not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of by the parties, without this Requiſite: Chriſt hath this Requiſite moſt eminently; he is ſuch a Perſon who is not only of Kindred to both parties, but by that rare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the two Natures in his Perſon, who is <hi>God man,</hi> he is equally diſtant from, and drawing near to both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (whereof I ſpoke before when I treated of the Union of the two Natures: and therefore will not inſiſt here).</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Mediator muſt be a Perſon <hi>truſted</hi> by both parties: one to whom they can confidently intruſt their Intereſts: ſuch a perſon is Chriſt, to whom God hath entruſted and committed whatſoever relateth to his Honour and Intereſt: <hi>John</hi> 5.22, 27, <hi>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all judgment to the Son—And hath given him authority to execute judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.</hi> He is a Perſon, a Truſtee, to whom we may commit all our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts: yea, Believers have done ſo, and will do ſo, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19, <hi>Commit the keeping of your ſouls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12, <hi>And I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him, againſt that day:</hi> Yea, he is the perſon to whom our Intereſts were committed by God before we were born, and before we were capable to diſpoſe of our own intereſts. When we were Minors, yea before we were, <hi>John</hi> 17.6, <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me, and they have kept thy word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A Mediator muſt be a Perſon which is <hi>well-affected</hi> to, and which ſeeketh the welfare of both parties: one who <hi>deſires their union</hi> and agreement, elſe he were not fit to deal betwixt them: ſuch a perſon is Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant; one who deſireth and endeavoureth Gods honour and our happineſs; one who carrieth on his Fathers Honour in the promoting of our happineſs; and one who carrieth on our happineſs in ſuch way as may moſt highly advance his Fathers Honour: one who is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly affected to the union of the diſagreeing parties:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58137:128"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> 8.49, <hi>But I honour my father, and ye do diſhonour me:</hi> with <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14, <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A Mediator muſt be a Perſon which hath power over both the parties: one that may determine the difference, and engage the parties to ſtand to the deciſion: one that can <hi>lay his hands on both,</hi> Job 9.33. Such a perſon is Chriſt, who hath power with God, being his only Natural Son, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleaſed.</hi> John 11.41, 42, <hi>Father, I thank thee that thou haſt heard me; and I know that thou heareſt me always.</hi> And a perſon who hath power with us, can draw us after him, and make us do what he will. <hi>John</hi> 12.32, <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi> Pſal. 119.35, <hi>Make me to go in the path of thy Commandments.</hi> Ezek. 36.27, <hi>And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes: and ye ſhall keep my judgments, and do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There are other Requiſites, which relate more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the managing ſuch a work. And 1. A Mediator muſt be a <hi>condeſcending</hi> Perſon, which can humble himſelf, and bow, for the compaſſing an union betwixt the parties: Chriſt is ſuch a Perſon. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.9, <hi>Behold, thy king cometh—he is lowly.</hi> A condeſcending Mediator, whoſe condeſcenſions were eminent. 1. He ſhewed himſelf very condeſcending in taking on the Office of a Mediator. In this he bowed himſelf, and ſtooped very low: he came off the Throne, and left it, to take on a ſervice, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men: And b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in faſhon as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs.</hi> 2. Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to take on the duties of that Office: he became a ſervant to both parties, that he might make peace betwixt them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth.</hi> Ver. 53.11, <hi>By his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58137:129"/>their iniquity.</hi> Matt. 20.28, <hi>Even as the Son of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſom for many.</hi> 3. Condeſcending in his way of going about that Office, and the things pertaining to it: conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to the weakeſt and loweſt condition of his people, and ſhewing his dealings accordingly. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.2, 3, <hi>He ſhall not cry, nor lift, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreet; a bruiſed reed ſhall be not break.</hi> And 40.11, <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a ſhepherd, he ſhall gather the lambs with his arms, and ſhall gather them in his boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> Ezek. 34.16, <hi>I will ſeek that which was loſt, and bring again that which was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away: and I will bind up that which was broken, and will ſtrengthen that which was ſick,</hi> 4. Condeſcending in all his carriage: not ſeeking his own honour, nor affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting popularity, but doing his greateſt works with little noiſe, and bidding tell no man of them. <hi>John</hi> 6.15, <hi>When Jeſus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himſelf alone.</hi> Mat. 12.18, 19, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I have choſen, mine elect in whom my ſoul is well-pleaſed; I will put my ſpirit upon him, and he ſhall ſhew judgment to the Gentiles: he ſhall not ſtrive nor cry, neither ſhall any man hear his voice in the ſtreets.</hi> And 8.4, <hi>And Jeſus ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, See thou tell no man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A Mediator in carrying his buſineſs, muſt be <hi>mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to bring the parties from rigour and high courſes and conditions, to abate for peace and union-ſake. This did eminently ſhine forth in Chriſt; he was a mollifying Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; for 1. He brought God down, and took him off high demands of Law: 1. Inſtead of perſonal ſatisfaction from Sinners, to accept of ſatisfaction in the perſon of another, to wit, Chriſt our Surety, who was <hi>made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. Iſa 53.8, <hi>For the tranſgreſſions of mp people was he ſtricken.</hi> 2. In place of an inherent righteouſneſs, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept an imputed Righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> 3.

               <p n="2">2. He hath brought up man in his own body, to come nearer to God, and to leave the terms whereupon he ſtood at odds with God before: 1.

               <p n="3">3. A Mediator muſt be <hi>affable,</hi> one to whom both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may freely tell their mind, and have acceſs to do ſo. Chriſt is an affable Mediator, a Perſon who courteouſly and kindly entertaineth both the parties in whatſoever they will employ him; and this for the unions-ſake, that he may make them one. 1. He is affable to both parties, for he hath Gods heart, and a mans heart.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt is an affable Mediator, in reſpect of his Father, the offended party: and no wonder, for he dwelleth <hi>in his boſom,</hi> Joh. 1.18. He doth kindly entertain and receive his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, <hi>John</hi> 6.38, 39, <hi>For I came down from heaven, not to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58137:130"/>do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me: And this is the fathers will that hath ſent me,</hi> &amp;c. 2. He is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable Mediator in reſpect of the offending-party: one who kindly and courteouſly receiveth and etertaineth the worſt of ſinners that ever employed him: His carriage while he was here on earth, did throughly bear witneſs of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, and after his reſurrection; whereby he gave a proof how he would carry to us when he ſhould be in glory, being then in the way and firſt ſtep to it. O, how affable was he then! <hi>Luke</hi> 24. John 20, and 21 Chapters. And how affable is he ſtill now, when he is ſet down on the right hand of Majeſty! <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.25, 26, 27, <hi>The time cometh when I ſhall no more ſpeak unto you in Proverbs, but I ſhall ſhew you plainly of the Father.— At that day ye ſhall ask in my name: and I ſay not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himſelf loveth you.</hi> Heb. 2.17, <hi>That he might be a merciful High-prieſt in things pertaining to God.</hi> And 5.2, <hi>Who can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way, for that he himſelf alſo is compaſſed with infirmities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He is affable to Juſtice and Mercy both, theſe two Attributes in God which were to be eminently glorified in our Salvation: 1. He is affable to Juſtice, ready always to ſpeak with Juſtice, and to ſatisfie it with a Ranſom and Price, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24, <hi>And to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things than that of Abel.</hi> 2. He is affable to Mercy and Grace, and ready always to ſatisfie Mercy by entreaties, even for the thing which he hath bought, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them:</hi> Yea, he pleads in our name with both theſe Attributes in God, by virtue of his ſatisfaction and interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24, <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true: but into heaven it ſelf, now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the preſence of God for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A Mediator muſt be <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> for the Unions-ſake, to bear with both the parties, although they ſhould ſmite him, and be angry with him: Chriſt is ſuch a Mediator, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.5, <hi>Tell the daughter of Zion, behold, thy king cometh unto thee, meek, and ſitting upon an aſs, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58137:130"/>a colt, the foal of an aſs.</hi> And 11.29, <hi>I am meek and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heart. Moſes</hi> in his Mediation was a type of him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.3, <hi>Now the man Moſes was very meek above all the men that were upon the face of the earth.</hi> O ſo meek a Mediator as Chriſt is! 1. He endured his Fathers anger and wrath for our ſake, and was ſmitten by him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief:</hi> Rom. 8.32, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.</hi> 2. He endured our anger alſo; he was ſmitten by the other party, by his own, for whoſe ſake he was content to be ſmitten of his Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.38, <hi>But when the husbandmen ſaw the Son, they ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, This is the heir, let us kill him, and let us ſeize on his Inheritance.</hi> Iſa. 53.3, <hi>He is deſpiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of men: a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was deſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not:</hi> And when he was ſmitten by both parties at once, and endured the wrath and diſpleaſure of both at the ſame time, yet he carried as a meek Mediator, who did bear all for the Unions-ſake, that he might make peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7, <hi>He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth:</hi> with 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.23, <hi>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi> He went through all the buſineſs with little clamour, noiſe or complaint, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Mediator muſt be <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>tender-hearted,</hi> one that hath bowels to pity the unreconciled ſtate of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Chriſt is eminently ſuch a Perſon. 1. One who hath conjoyned in his perſon the heart of God, and the heart of a man: the infinite mercy of God, and the kindly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of an experienced man; who in his Humane nature hath felt our afflictions and temptations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18, <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-Prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people: For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> And
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58137:131"/>5.2, <hi>Who can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way: for that he himſelf alſo is compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with infirmity.</hi> 2. A Perſon, who in all his dealings hath ſhewed himſelf merciful, and hath evidenced his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate diſpoſition: one that hath ſhewed mercy to all that ever came to God through him, and upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ever were given him, to ſhew himſelf ſuch. <hi>John</hi> 6.37, <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Matth. 15.22, <hi>And behold a woman of Canaan came out of the ſame coaſts, and cryed unto him, ſaying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David: my daughter is grievouſly vexed with a Devil.</hi> And 9.27, <hi>And when Jeſus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying and ſaying, Thou Son of David have mercy on us.</hi> One who ſhewed mercy, not only upon the matter, but even in the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his dealings with his people: <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20, <hi>A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, till he ſend forth judgment into victory.</hi> And 9.17, <hi>Neither do men put new wine into old bottles, elſe the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles periſh; but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preſerved.</hi> One who carryeth compaſſionately unto, and is pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful even of the wilful refuſers of his mercy, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41, <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it,</hi> &amp;c. One who was not only pitiful in the days of his fleſh, but hath carryed alſo the ſame heart and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of a merciful and compaſſionate Mediator unto heaven with him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18, <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> And 4.15, <hi>For we have not an High-prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities: but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> 1 John 2.1, <hi>And if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. A Mediator muſt be <hi>Potent,</hi> and able to compaſs his undertaking: Chriſt is ſuch a Mediator, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19, <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty.</hi> Iſa. 9.6, <hi>His name ſhall be called—the mighty God.</hi> He is a potent Mediator, 1. In reſpect of the power that is in his hands: Conſider his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58137:131"/>to compaſs the work committed unto him, in reſpect of his eſſential power and kingdom, and in reſpect of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſatory power and kingdom, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7, <hi>He is able to ſave to the utmoſt,</hi> perfectly. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, <hi>He is mighty to ſave,</hi> Iſa. 63.1. He is able to ſave from ſin, and all that is in it, whether guilt, power, or defilement: and from wrath, and all that may follow upon it: he is able to ſupply all our wants, and to do for us <hi>exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think,</hi> Phil. 4.19. Eph. 3.20. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his ability to perform whatſoever he hath undertaken, and that as well for God to man, as for man to God. He is able to do what ever he hath engaged to us on Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; <hi>to finiſh the work that he gave him to do,</hi> John 17.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for this cauſe he is a King by Covenant, and hath <hi>all power in heaven and earth given to him,</hi> Mat. 28.18. Heb. 10.12, <hi>But this man after he had offered one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſins, for ever ſate down on the right hand of God.</hi> Chap. 8. <hi>v.</hi> 1, <hi>Now of the things which we have ſpoken, this is the ſum, We have ſuch an High-prieſt who is ſet on the right hand of the throne of the Majeſty in the heaven.</hi> Eph. 1.20.21, 22, <hi>And ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come. And hath put all things under his feet, and given him to be head over all things to the Church.</hi> 2. He is a potent Mediator in reſpect of the truſt and delegation of power given to him, for ſetling and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the difference betwixt the parties: the arbitration being rendred up to him to determine and lay his hands on both, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, <hi>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Son.</hi> This is a great power that is put in Chriſts hands, that he ſhall order the ſatisfaction that ſhall be given, ſo as to bring about the giving of it upon the one part, and the acceptation of it upon the other part, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18, <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life, that I might take it again.—I have power to lay it down, and I have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take it again.</hi> Chap. 17. <hi>v.</hi> 2, <hi>As thou haſt given him pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> 3.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:58137:132"/>with whom he is very gracious, and hath power with him to procure his acceptance of ſuch ſatisfaction as he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> And to obtain from him whatſoever he deſireth for the believer of the other party, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.42, <hi>And I knew that thou heareſt me always.</hi> Chap. 17. <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi> 2. He hath a powerful intereſt with man, to make him offer the ſatisfaction which his Father is content to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. To make him <hi>ſubject his conſent to the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.13. Joh. 12.32, <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi> And to make him walk in that way which may pleaſe his Father, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, <hi>I will put my ſpirit in you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes.</hi> A potent Mediator, that hath a great ſtroak of power with both the parties, to reconcile God to man, by his accepting the ſacrifice of Chriſts death; and to reconcile man to God, by his humbling himſelf to offer ſatisfaction to God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A Mediator muſt be <hi>faithful</hi> and true to the intereſt of both parties in his Mediation, ſeeking and ſtudying their good: Chriſt is eminently ſuch, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4. and 3.14. and 19.11.</p>
               <p>Conſider how he is faithful to both the parties, and how he is faithful to the buſineſs of reconciliation, which is the end of a Mediator.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is faithful to the parties. And, 1. To God, <hi>he is faithful to him that appointed him,</hi> Heb. 3.2. True to his fathers intereſt, in ſeeking his honour, executing his will, ſatisfying his juſtice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38, <hi>For I came down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> Chap. 8. <hi>v.</hi> 49, <hi>I honour my Father, and ye diſhonour me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He is faithful to man, and true to his intereſt in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectually with his Father on our behalf, in all things wherein we have dealing with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, <hi>That he might be a merciful and faithful High-prieſt in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining unto God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people.</hi> 1 John 2.1, <hi>We have an advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:58137:132"/>2. He is faithful to the buſineſs, which is the end of his Office; to wit, reconciliation, and making friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the parties: this being entruſted to him, he makes it his work, and minds it exceedingly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.49, <hi>Wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my Fathers buſineſs?</hi> Joh. 4.34, <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi> And this appeareth, 1. In his faithful agenting the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our peace in Heaven, whither he is gone for the making and maintaining peace between God and his people, there to <hi>appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9.24. Joh. 17. throughout. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3, <hi>And another angel came and ſtood at the altar, having a golden cenſor, and there was given to him much incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all ſaints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</hi> 2. In his faithful reporting back again to his people what may be expected by them at his Fathers hands: he is the <hi>meſſenger of the Covenant, and the true and faithful witneſs,</hi> Mal. 3.1. Rev. 1.5. Joh. 14.2, <hi>In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe are many manſions, if it were not ſo I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> Eph. 2.17, <hi>And came and preached peace to them which were afar off, and to them that were night.</hi> Joh. 1.18, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time: the only begotten Son which is in the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he hath declared him.</hi> 3. In his effectual procuring his peoples peace with his Father: he never giveth over dealing in the buſineſs, until it be done and ended, and the treaty be cloſed and ſigned; until he <hi>have finiſhed the work.</hi> Joh. 17.4, 24. and have ſaid unto his people, <hi>Peace I give unto you,</hi> Joh. 14.27. Eph. 2.14, 15, 16, <hi>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us: Having aboliſhed in his fleſh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for to make in himſelf, of twain, one new man, ſo making peace. And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the croſs, having ſlain the enmity thereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. A Mediator muſt be a <hi>Wooer</hi> of both the parties, to bring them in friendſhip together: The Mediator of the new Covenant did this eminently, he wooed God for us, and wooed us for God, which none of the parties had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to do immediately, without his interpoſing betwixt them;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58137:133"/>and this he doth ſeveral ways: 1. By praiſing and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the parties, and ſpeaking good of each of them to the other, as it were behind their backs: he commendeth God to us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39, <hi>And this is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day.</hi> Chap. 14. <hi>v.</hi> 2, <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many manſions, if it were not ſo I would have told it you: I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> Chap. 16. <hi>v.</hi> 17, <hi>For the Father himſelf loveth you.</hi> And he commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8, 25, <hi>For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.—O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and theſe have known that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> 2. By pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and requeſting both the parties to be at peace: he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth his Father to be at peace with us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9, <hi>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them that thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</hi> And he entreats and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts us to be reconciled with his Father, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20, <hi>Now then we are ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled to God.</hi> 3. By engaging and becoming Surety to both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for all that he ſpeaketh in the name of any of the parties unto the other, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22, <hi>By ſo much was Jeſus made ſurety of a better Teſtament.</hi> He maketh ſaith, and undertaketh that we ſhall find God as good as the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he puts upon him; and he maketh faith to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that he ſhall make us anſwer his promiſes in our name; and what we do not he ſhall do for us.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A Mediator muſt be of a <hi>Couragious</hi> and unſubdued ſpirit, to go through difficulties, diſcouragement, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, without being layed by in his work: elſe in dealing for reconciliation betwixt parties that are at a great diſtance, he ſhould be ſoon diſcouraged: Chriſt is eminently ſuch a perſon; he goeth on in the work of redemption and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, ſaving his people, and ſubduing his enemies; and though there be many enemies to this peace, and many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements be caſt in his way from ſome of the parties themſelves; yet doth he go on in his work with a heroick
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58137:133"/>and undaunted ſpirit, he can neither be bowed, nor broken, nor laid by. Pſal. 42.4, <hi>He ſhall not fail, nor be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, till he have ſet judgment in the earth: and the Iſles ſhall wait for his law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He was not broken nor diſcouraged by the weight of the work which he had undertaken, his duty broke him not, but he went on in it till he had ended his work. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> We read indeed that he wept ſometimes, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. but he was not diſcouraged then, but went on to do his work; the courage of faith of his victory was not ſhaken nor cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. His enemies, and all the oppoſition they could make to him, did not break him, nor lay him by, he would go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where they ſought to kill him, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.51, <hi>And it came to paſs, when the time was come that he ſhould be received up, he ſtedfaſtly ſet his face to go to Jeruſalem.</hi> And 13.32, <hi>And he ſaid unto them, Go ye, and tell that Fox, Behold I caſt out Devils, and I do cures to day, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and the third day I ſhall be perfected.</hi> He would walk on his twelve hours, he knew not what unbelieving fear was. 3. His ſufferings did not break him, nor lay him by from his work; when he ſweat blood, and when he ſuffered on the Croſs, even then he ſet about his duty, and intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it not, but minded ſinners more than himſelf; often in prayer, caring for his Mother, preaching to the thief, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 22 chapters. 4. His cold and bad entertainment which he got from his people when he was about his work, did not break him, nor lay him by, <hi>John</hi> 1.10, 11, <hi>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</hi> And the many ſcoffs, and the ſlighting carriage of his people, and the grieving his ſpirit, and breaking his heart every day yet, doth not diſcourage him, nor lay him by from his work, and from endeavours for their reconciliation with God, Rom. 10. laſt, <hi>But unto Iſrael he ſaith, All day long I have ſtretched forth my hands unto a diſobedient and gainſaying people.</hi> Luke 19.41, 42, <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, ſaying, If thou haſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace, but now they are bid

The diſpleaſure and wrath of both the parties, which he knew he behoved to go through, brake him not, laid him not by, but he ventured to take on the diſpleaſure of both, that he might agree them, and take away the difference, Zech. 13.7, <hi>Awake, O ſword, againſt my ſhepherd, and againſt the man that is my fellow, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. Smite the ſhepherd, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; and I will turn my hand upon the little ones.</hi> Luke 19.14, <hi>But his Citizens hated him.</hi> Mat. 21.38, <hi>This is the heir, come let us kill him, and let us ſeize on his inheritance.</hi> 6. The fair offers of the world, and ſmiles of temptation from it, laid him not by, nor took him off the work which he came to do, Joh. 6.15, <hi>When Jeſus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, and make him a King, he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again into a mountain himſelf alone.</hi> Mat. 4.8, 9, <hi>Again the Devil taketh him up unto an exceeding high Mountain, and ſheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, and ſaith unto him, All theſe things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worſhip me.</hi>

               <p>Beſides all theſe Requiſites in a Mediator which ſhine forth ſo eminently in Jeſus the Mediator of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, there are alſo ſome other Properties in our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, qualifying him for that Office, which are peculiar to his Mediation, and are not to be found in any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator among men; namely, 1. His Oneneſs and Sameneſs with both the parties betwixt whom he mediates. There have been mediators among men who have had ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts and relations to both parties, but never any like to this one and only Mediator of the New Covenant, who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly one with both the parties which ſtand at ſo great diſtance, Phil. 2.6, <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Heb. 2.17, <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren.</hi> And therefore he is ſo much engaged to make them one in him; he is nearly concerned in the union of theſe two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: 1. In point of Intereſt, he gaineth by it, his Fathers honour is gain to him, and ſo is our happineſs alſo, <hi>John</hi> 16.14, 15, <hi>He ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you. All things that the Father hath, are mine, therefore ſaid I, that he ſhall take of mine, and ſhall

In point of Faithfulneſs, he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it, and will do it, for he is <hi>faithful and true,</hi> Rev. 1.5. and 3.14. and 19.11. 3. In point of Honour; 'tis a Crown to him to make the agreement betwixt God and man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, 5, <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do: And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi> Iſa. 53.12, <hi>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong; becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death, and he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors, and he bare the ſin of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Pſal. 110. laſt, <hi>He ſhall drink of the brook in the way, therefore ſhall he lift up the head.</hi> 4. In point of Satisfaction; it's comfort to him to ſee this union, Iſa. 53.11, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt is a Mediator, who never declined to mediate in the buſineſs of all thoſe who have any dealing with the King and Court where he lies, being a potent, acceſſible Mediator to all who will employ him, Heb. 7.25, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſsion for them.</hi> Joh. 6.37, <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come unto me: and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>

That Chriſt executeth this Office of Mediatorſhip according to both natures. 2. That he executed this Office from the beginning of the World, before he came in the fleſh. 3. That he executeth this Office, as well in the ſtate of his exaltation, as in the ſtate of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  </note> According to which Nature Chriſt is Mediator? Whether according to his Divine Nature <hi>as God,</hi> or according to his human Nature only <hi>as Man,</hi> or according to both <hi>as God-man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt part of the Popiſh Writers hold that Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the Office of Mediatorſhip, not according to his Divine Nature, but according to his Human Nature, only <hi>as Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Orthodox Divines, hold that Chriſt is Mediator accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to both Natures, and doth not execute that Office only as God, nor only as Man, but as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> God-man.</p>
               <p>For clearing whereof, I ſhall premiſe a few things. 1. The Queſtion is not, whether there be in the Mediator the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of both natures in the unity of his Perſon? for that is confeſſed by all. But whether both Natures concur in the Works of Mediation, or in the execution of that Office. 2. Nor is the Queſtion, Whether the two Natures in Chriſt be diſtinct in their eſſence and properties, and ſo in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, for we yeild that the Human Nature doth that which pertaineth to the Humanity, and the Divine Nature that which pertaineth to the Divinity: yet ſo, as the Natures being united in one Perſon, ſo the operations concur to make up one Work of a Mediator, the Human and Divine Natures concurring to produce one act or work of Mediatorſhip. 3. Nor is the Queſtion, Whether all the Works of Chriſt the Mediator, were the Works of both Natures: For it is certain, ſome of them were the Works of his Humanity, ſome of his Divinity, in reſpect of the thing done: but, Whether there were not a concurrence of both Natures acting jointly, although diſtinctly in the performing of them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Both Natures concur in Chriſts performing the Office of Mediatorſhip, and what he doth as Mediator he doth as <hi>God-man,</hi> may be confirmed by theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. According to what Nature Chriſt is the King, Prieſt, and Prophet of his Church, accordingly he is Mediator, for he carried theſe Offices as he was Mediator: but according to both Natures, Chriſt is King, Prieſt, and Prophet of his Church; for according to the approved rule, <hi>Names of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:58137:139"/>Office which are given to Chriſt, they agree to him according to both Natures:</hi> therefore Chriſt executes the Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip as God-man, according to both Natures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Godhead of Chriſt concurred with the Manhood in all the acts of Mediatorſhip: then Chriſt performeth not the Office of Mediator as Man only, but as God-man: but we find the Godhead intereſted in every act which Chriſt did, or doth as Mediator: It is evident from the ſeveral acts of each of his Offices, from his Obedience, Suffering, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Interceſſion, <hi>Heb</hi> 9.14, <hi>How much more ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered up himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your Conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God.</hi> And 7.25, <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> Eph. 1.19, 20, <hi>According to the working of his power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.</hi> None of which could be performed by his Human Nature alone, without concurrence of his Godhead. True it is indeed, we may conceive ſome Acts wherein the Humanity of Chriſt did not concur with his Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe that he wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Incarnation: but none wherein his Humanity acted without his Divinity. It followeth therefore, that Chriſt performeth this Office as God-man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If many chief eſſential acts of Chriſts Mediation, are from the Deity of Chriſt, as from the next, proper, formal, and immediate cauſe, then Chriſt performeth not the Office of Mediator as Man only, but as God-man: but many chief eſſential acts of Chriſts Mediation are from his Deity, as the next, proper, formal, immediate cauſe: <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The Minor is proved by theſe inſtances: The Incarnation of Chriſt is from the Deity, which did aſſume the Humanity; which when it was not, could not aſſume it ſelf. The manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God was a work truly divine, which was from the Deity as the true cauſe; though from the Humanity as an Inſtrument, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time: the only begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> Matth. 11.27, <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no man knoweth the Son but the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58137:139"/>Father, neither knoweth any man the Father fave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him.</hi> Chriſt as Man teacheth as an Inſtrument, and Chriſt the Word teacheth as Mediator; the works of Authority and Power were all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If Chriſt as Mediator performed many divine acts, which cannot be from his Humanity alone, Then Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth not the Office of Mediatorſhip as Man only, but as God alſo: But Chriſt as Mediator performeth many Divine acts, which cannot be from his Humanity alone, ſuch as his riſing from the dead, which was by the power of his Deity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4, <hi>And declared to be the Son of God with power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit of holineſs, by the reſurection of Jeſus from the dead.</hi> And 8.3, 4, <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again; who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> Eph. 1.19, 20, Chriſt as Mediator hath power and authority to forgive ſins, and ſend the holy Spirit, to enlighten the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, to ſoften the hearts of men, and that not only meritoriouſly, but efficiently, which are the proper works of God: <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.10, <hi>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive ſins.</hi> Joh. 15.26, <hi>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſtify of me.</hi> And 16.7, <hi>But if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, I will ſend him unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If none of the works performed by Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whether the works of Miniſtry that were performed by him, in the Nature of man, or the works of Authority and Power performed by the Divine Nature, were performed without the concurring of the other Nature in Chriſt; Then Chriſt performeth the Office of Mediator not as God alone, nor as Man only, but according to both Natures as <hi>God-man:</hi> but the former is true, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The Major is proved by parts. 1. The works of Miniſtry which were performed in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, and were the works of Chriſts Humanity, ſuch as were his death upon the Croſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the Divine Nature was concurring in theſe, not only to ſupport and ſuſtain the Human, but the thing done had its efficacy, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and value, from his Divinity, in that they were the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58137:140"/>works of him that is God. It was the Son of God, the Lord of life, that died on the Croſs, but it was the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, not of God, wherein he died; yet it was the Divine Nature that did ſupport him, and gave worth to his ſacrifice. 2. The works of authority and power, ſuch as the remitting of ſins, giving the Spirit, raiſing the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were the works of his Divine Nature; yet were not done without an inſtrumental concurrence of the Nature of man.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If the end of the Perſonal union of the two Natures of Chriſt, be the fitting and qualifying of him for the Office of Mediatorſhip (as is before cleared), then the two Natures do and muſt neceſſarily concur in the works of mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (at leaſt after theſe were united) elſe the union of the two Natures had not been neceſſary in Chriſt; for the ſame neceſſity is for the concurring of the proper works of the two Natures in the Mediators work, that is, for the union of the two Natures in his perſon: the end of that union being to fit him to act in this Office as a qualified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 2. That Chriſt hath executed this Office ever ſince the beginning of the World, ever ſince the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was diſſolved and broken, ſince enmity entered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, as well before his being made manifeſt
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58137:141"/>in the fleſh, as after; as well before and under the Law, as in the dayes of the New Teſtament: For although he be called <hi>Mediator of the New Covenant,</hi> or <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> Heb. 12.24. which is to be underſtood, 1. by way of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the firſt Covenant, whereof he was not Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe he was then exhibited, and then he perfected the work of Redemption: Yet did Chriſt enter upon the execution and execriſe of this Office of Mediatorſhip (to which he was before deſigned) from the time that fallen man was at variance with God; the execution of this Office extends to the firſt ages of the World, from the time that the promiſe made to our firſt parents (while they were yet in Paradice) took place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15, <hi>It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf.</hi> Heb. 13.8, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame yeſterday, and to day and for ever.</hi> Gal. 3.17, <hi>And this I ſay, that the Covenant that was before confirmed of Chriſt, the Law which was Four hundred and thirty years after, cannot diſannul, that it ſhould make the promiſe of none effect. Rev.</hi> 13.8: he is called <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world:</hi> As in reſpect of Gods deſtination, being deſigned before time, to be offered up in time; ſo alſo in reſpect of the efficacy of his ſacrifice and mediation, which extended to the firſt ages of the world. For, 1. From that time there was need of a Mediator. 2. From that time begun the works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to be deſtroyed: <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15, <hi>And I will put enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and the Woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed: it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.8, <hi>He that commiteth ſin is of the Devil, for the Devil ſinneth from the beginning; for this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> 3. From that time were ſome ſinners ſaved, by the Meſſiah that was to come: Therefore from thence we muſt reckon the exerciſe of his Mediatorſhip.</p>
               <p>Underſtand this with three diſtinctions. 1. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts Incarnation, he was a Mediator <hi>virtually,</hi> and undiſcernedly, <hi>i. e.</hi> the virtue and efficacy of that Office, to which he was deſigned, did extend to the firſt ages of the world, (though the way of his acting in that Office before his Incarnation, tranſcend our underſtanding) but after
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58137:141"/>his Incarnation, when he had taken our nature upon him; then he was manifeſtly an <hi>actual</hi> Mediator. 2. Before his Incarnation he was not <hi>Compleatly</hi> fitted for all the parts of that Office, not being yet the <hi>Man Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, but after his Incarnation he was a Compleat Mediator: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 7, <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me. Then ſaid I, Lo I come, (in the volume of the Book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.</hi> 3. Before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, he was ſecretly and <hi>inviſibly</hi> a Mediator in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: after his Incarnation, he did <hi>viſibly</hi> act that part upon Earth, and then went into the holieſt to continue in the exerciſe of this Office, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24, <hi>Now to appear in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God for us.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> This alſo ſhould contribute to eſtabliſh our faith, while ur Mediator is abſent from us, or rather while we are abſent from him, and he is out of our ſight: If this Office was effectual for the good of believers, before he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offered ſacrifice, or interceded, how much more when he hath actually done both theſe? Have we any better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Faith? if his Mediation was effectual before he was a compleat Mediator, and had not yet taken our nature upon him, ſhall we not believe now the efficacy thereof, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is the <hi>Man Chriſt?</hi> If his Mediation was effectual while he had not yet come down from Heaven to act vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly here on Earth; how much more when he hath finiſhed the work, and is now returned, and gotten his Fathers wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? Believe it, he is at Court, though he be out of our ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſion</hi> 3. That Jeſus the Mediator of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant executeth this Office, as well in the ſtate of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, as Humiliation. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24, 25, <hi>But this man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Prieſthood. Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the utmoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> But with ſome obſervable difference, which is to be ſeen, 1. In his exerciſing, the three Offices which were parts of his Mediatorſhip. And, 2. In the diſtinct parts of theſe Offices.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was mainly his Prieſtly Office, which the Mediator
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58137:142"/>diſcharged here on Earth, in his ſtate of Humiliation; his entry upon his Kingly Adminiſtration, being eminently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the ſtate of Exaltation: <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3, <hi>When he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſate down on the right hand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty on high.</hi> And, 8.1, <hi>We have an High-prieſt, who is ſet on the right hand of the throne of the Majeſty in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> Phil. 2.8, 9, <hi>And being found in faſhion, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs. Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him.</hi> Mat. 28.18, <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> But his Prophetical. Office was excerciſed by him in both theſe ſtates, of his Humiliation, and Exaltation: <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47, <hi>And that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations, beginning at Jeruſalem.</hi> Heb. 12.25, <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh; for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpoke on Earth, much more ſhall we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven.</hi>

                  </label> Whether the Angels have any ſhare in Chriſts Mediation? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſeem to appropriate the benefit of Chriſts Mediation to Mankind. Yet I conceive they may admit one native
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58137:143"/>interpretation, without ſtraining the word, which doth not ſhut out the Angels. The firſt Scripture is that, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> which ſeems to ſet forth the object of Chriſts Mediation to be men, not Angels; but conſider, that there is a twofold Mediation of Chriſt; the one of Redemption or Reconciliation, the other of Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or confirmation: Chriſt is only a Mediator of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption betwixt God and man, for he never undertook for the fallen Angels, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41, <hi>Then ſhall he ſay unto them on his left hand, Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Jude, ver. 6, <hi>And the Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation, he hath reſerved in everlaſting chains under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unto the judgment of the great day.</hi> And of this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſpeaks that Text, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, A Mediation which had a ranſom and propitiation in it: that Chriſt died only for man, not for the Angels. The other Scripture is that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16, <hi>For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham:</hi> Which will indeed prove, and ſpeaketh it plainly, that when fallen men and Angels were before him, ſinking into their miſery, he took hold of the one, not of the other: And ſo that none of the fallen Angels have benefit by Chriſts Mediation: It will prove that herein Chriſt expreſſed his love more to Men than Angels, in that he ſaved ſome of the fallen men, but none of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and would carry this Office not in their Nature, but in ours; Yet I conceive it will not prove that the elect Angels have no benefit by Chriſts Mediation. I incline therefore to think it moſt probable, that the elect Angels are not to be excluded from the benefit of Chriſts Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whether they had need of a Mediator or not (as <hi>Calvin</hi> upon <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. laboureth to prove), I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; but theſe two things only I ſhall ſpeak of: 1. I ſhall ſhew, that the good Angels have benefit by Chriſt, which is certain. 2. That there are probable grounds to judg, that they have this benefit through Chriſts Mediation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By Chriſt the Angels have knowledg of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Salvation, even a glorious addition of knowledg, by this new diſcovery and bright manifeſtation of God in all
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58137:143"/>his Atributes that have ſhined forth in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10, <hi>To the intent that now unto the Principalitics and Powers in Heavenly places, might be known by the Church, the manifold wiſdom of God.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12, <hi>Which things the Angels did deſire to look into.</hi> 2. By Chriſt they have an honourable Office, they became Principalities and Powers in governing the world; and Miniſtring Spirits, that Chriſt may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in the Church, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, <hi>For by him were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſible: whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, or Powers, all things were created by him, and for him.</hi> Heb. 1.14, <hi>Are they not all miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be heirs of Salvation.</hi> And therefore when Chriſt ſhall give up his diſpenſatory King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, then ſhall all rule be put down, which is not only to be underſtood of the being of no Magiſtracy, and no Miniſtry, but even of the Angels, Principalities, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. 3. By Chriſt the Angels have joy at the converſion of ſinners. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10, <hi>Likewiſe I ſay unto you, there is Joy in the preſence of the Angels of God, over one ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth.</hi> Matth. 18.10, <hi>Take heed that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones: For I ſay unto you, that in Heaven their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do alwayes behold the face of my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Luke 2.13, <hi>And ſuddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host, praiſing God.</hi> By Chriſt the Angels have a more perfect and firm union with God, a kind of econciliation, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20, <hi>And having made peace by the blood of his Croſs, by him to reconcile all things to himſelf: by him I ſay, whether they be things on Earth, or things in Heaven.</hi> Where by <hi>things in Heaven,</hi> is underſtood An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who are ſaid to be reconciled to God, not <hi>properly:</hi> for where there is no breach, there can be no reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this is peculiar unto man, but improperly and <hi>annalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically</hi> they may be ſaid to be reconciled, by confirming and eſtabliſhing them in the grace and favour of God, <hi>Tollendo peccata hominum &amp; poſſibilitatem peccandi in Angelis:</hi> taking away all poſſibility of defection in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe benefits which the Angels certainly have by Chriſt, they may be probably conceived to have them by Chriſts Mediation: 1. Becauſe Chriſt is a head to the elect
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:58137:144"/>Angels as well as to elect men; and they are part of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10, <hi>And ye are compleat in him which is the head of all Principality and Power.</hi> Eph. 1.10. <hi>That in the Diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are on Earth, even in him:</hi> they are reckoned a part of the Catholick Church, and inhabitants of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem, Heb.</hi> 12.23, 24, Now if Chriſt be head of the Church as he is Mediator, then whatſoever benefit they, as part of his Body, have from Chriſt the Head, I do not ſee how we can avoid to ſay they muſt have it through his Mediation: For how can it be conceived that one part of Chriſts Body hath benefit from Chriſts Mediation, and another part of it hath benefit by him, and yet another way than by his mediation? 2. Becauſe whatſoever benefit the Angels have by Chriſt, they were elected unto it; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21, <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the elect Angels.</hi> Now Chriſt being the head of the election, in whom all that are elect are elected, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, <hi>According as he hath choſen us in Chriſt, before the foundation of the world:</hi> And the benefits unto which we are elected in Chriſt, coming through his Mediation, to all the elect; theſe muſt come ſo to the elect Angels alſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, 5, 10, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he hath choſen us in Chriſt, before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love: Having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children, by Jeſus Christ.—That in the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the fulneſs of time, he might gather together in one all things in Chriſt.</hi> 3.

                  </note> it hath that, not by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of its nature, but by grace: Now the elect Angels being freed from all poſſibility of ſinning, this they muſt have by Grace, which cometh not only from Chriſt, but through his Mediation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17, <hi>For the Law was given by Moſes, but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Christ:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome other thing ſupervenient, beſide the good of their natural condition wherein they were created, which was mutable.</p>
               <p>More particularly, The execution and work of Chriſts Mediatorſhip, may be reduced to theſe Five heads: 1. To
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58137:144"/>bring the elect into a capacity of covenanting with God. 2. To bring them within the bond of the Covenant, after he hath thus prepared the way. 3. To enable them whom he bringeth into this New-Covenant-ſtate, to perform the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Covenant. 4. To keep thoſe whom he bringeth into this Covenant ſtate, from falling away from it, or to enable them to continue in it. 5. To bring thoſe whom he hath brought up to the terms of a Covenant with God, to that height of that Bleſſedneſs which is appointed for them, and to Crown his work in them.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of the Mediators work, and execution of his Office is, to prepare a way for mans covenanting with God; to make the way of God acceſſible, and to put man in a capacity to enter in terms with God: For man by ſin was made uncapable of covenanting with God, until the Mediator cometh in to compoſe the difference, and to reſtore the love and friendſhip that once had been betwixt God and man; who to prepare a way for mans covenanting with God, doth two things himſelf, and worketh two things in us. The firſt, to make God acceſſible; the other, to make men capable of covenanting with God, who is made acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in Chriſts death. 1. He taketh on mans nature, that a Sacrifice might be among mankind, who had ſinned; he putteth his name in our Obligation, that the Law might reach him. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>God ſent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</hi> 2. In our nature he obeyeth the Law, and ſuffereth: he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a price for our Ranſom, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21, <hi>He is made ſin for us;</hi> an offering for ſin, he ſtood in the ſinners ſtead here, he purchaſeth a liberty to the elect, and hath it in his juſt and legal power to ſet them free when he will, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28, <hi>being the Church of God which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood.</hi> 3. He convinceth men of their ſin, and of their bondage, and impoſſibility to ſatisfy Juſtice, and to this end he attacheth them before Divine Juſtice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8, <hi>And when he is come, he will reprove the World of ſin, of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and of judgment.</hi> Rom. 7.9, <hi>For I was alive without the Law once: but when the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I died.</hi> Gal. 3.24, <hi>Wherefore the Law was our Schoolmaster
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58137:145"/>to bring us unto Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by Faith.</hi> 4. He worketh their Hearts to a yielding-frame, liſtning, and ready to welcom the news of delivery (which have not yet been actually ſpoken to their hearts), to be content to come out of their bondage, and to enjoy freedom by him: to be content to come in his will, and to yield the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to him, and to change the ſtate and righteouſneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſometimes they had no ſmall content, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.6, <hi>Lord, What wilt thou have me to do? Ariſe, and go into the City, and it ſhall be told thee what thou muſt do.</hi> They pant after a Saviour, as <hi>Paul</hi> did for compleat Redemption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.29, <hi>O wretched man that I am, Who ſhall deliver me from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this death?</hi> And when all this is done, Sinners are but in a capacity of covenanting with God, till more be done by Chriſt in the work of his Mediatorſhip for man: he is not yet in a covenant with God; all this is <hi>to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</hi> Luke 1.17. For though Chriſt hath payed the price of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ects ranſom, and hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their liberty on the Croſs, yea, and hath alſo convinced a man of his need of this ranſom, and made him toward and tractable to liſten, to accept of it; yet till a man come in by faith, and manifeſt his acceptance, or rather actually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſts propoſals, he is not yet actually in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, but concluded under wrath, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36, <hi>And he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the Mediators work and execution of his Office, is, to bring the elect within the bond of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. And for bringing about this, 1. Chriſt makes an offer of a New Covenant ſtate, with all ſuitable allurements and encouragements which may invite the Souls of the elect to accept of it; And for this end he hath appointed the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are Ambaſſadors for Christ, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled to God.</hi> And 6.17, 18, <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:58137:145"/>Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi> Iſa. 55.1, 3, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth; come ye to the waters—Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear and your Soul ſhall live: and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David.</hi> 2. He ſhapeth and frameth the hearts of his people for acceptation of his offer, and bringeth them unto a liking and ſatisfaction with the Covenant, and the terms of it; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5, <hi>For this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi> Pſal. 73. laſt, <hi>But it is good for me to draw near to God—I have put my truſt in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy works.</hi> 3. He actually maketh them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and enter into it: for after he hath ſhaped their hearts for acceptation, he actually engageth them by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and agreeing on their part, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14, 19, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore behold, I will allure her, and bring her unto the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſpeak comfortably unto her.—And I will betroth thee unto me for ever.</hi> Ezek. 20.37, <hi>And I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant.</hi> Joh. 6.37, <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me.</hi> And this he doth, 1. By ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us receive and welcom the Goſpel, and ſubject our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto it, by taking on the very bonds and rebukes of the Word, and yielding our ſelves captives unto it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13, <hi>Whiles by the experiment of this miniſtration they glorify God for your profeſſed ſubjection unto the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> And 10.4, <hi>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds.</hi> Rom. 6.17, <hi>But ye have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you.</hi> 2. By making us receive and <hi>embrace the Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 11.13, and <hi>take hold of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> Iſa. 56.4, 6. And this is a further ſtep of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators work, in making the Soul cloſe with God in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. 3. By making us receive Chriſt himſelf in the promiſes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12, <hi>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> For as Faith hath for the object of it, the whole Word of God; ſo eſpecially the promiſes, and more eſpecially Chriſt in the promiſes. 4. By making us give up our ſelves to be Chriſts, and no more our own; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.5, <hi>One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords:</hi> and by making us <hi>ſubject our Conſent</hi> unto him, as the Wife doth to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:58137:146"/>the Husband in a Marriage-Covenant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. And all this is the Mediators work, and the execution of his Office. For, 1. It is he that offers the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25, <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh.</hi> 2. It is he that ſhapeth the heart for acceptation of the offer, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.26, <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you,</hi> 3. It is he that engageth the heart to God by a Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21, <hi>And I will cauſe him to draw near, and he ſhall approach unto me; for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Joh. 12.32, <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the Earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi> 4. It is he that maketh us give up our ſelves to him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, 28, <hi>And I will put my Spirit into you, and cauſe you to walk in my wayes.—And ye ſhall be my people, and I will be your God.</hi> The third part of the Mediators work in the execution of his Office, is to enable them whom he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the Covenant of Grace, to perform the duty of the Covenant according to his undertaking to his Father on their behalf: and for this effect, 1. He circumciſeth their hearts, and taketh away the ſtone and natural averſneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt Covenant-duties, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6, <hi>And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, that thou maiſt live.</hi> Ezek. 36.26, <hi>And I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> 2. He engraffeth a new inward principle in their hearts, of compliance with, and propenſion unto their duty, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, <hi>I will put my Law into their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> And 32.40, <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> 3. He affordeth ſtrength to them, for performing the duties of the Covenant, and maketh his Grace effectual in them for that end: ſee <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.37, <hi>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments and do them.</hi> He craveth his Rent, and filleth the hand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pay it; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.11, <hi>Being filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs which are by Jeſus Chriſt, unto the glory and praiſe of God.</hi> 2 Cor. 9.8, <hi>And God is able to make all grace abound towards you, that ye alwayes having all-ſufficiency in all
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58137:146"/>things, may abound to every good work.</hi> 4. He breathes upon the graces of his people, and acteth them by daily freſh and quickening aſſiſtances, <hi>Song.</hi> 4.16, <hi>Awake, O North wind, and come, O South, blow upon my Garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out:</hi> Yea, he worketh in us, and for us, all that which we take upon us as duty in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12, <hi>For thou alſo haſt wrought all our works in us.</hi> Phil. 2.13, <hi>For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth part of the Mediators work in executing this Office, is, to keep thoſe whom he bringeth into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, from falling away from that bleſſed eſtate: If it were not for the Mediators travelling in this work, the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation once made could not ſtand: if he did not continue for ever Mediator of the New Covenant, we ſhould not for ever continue in that Covenant-ſtate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24, 25, <hi>But this man, becauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for them.</hi> And for keeping believers in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Chriſt the Mediator, beſide his contriving the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſo, that breaches ſhall not make it void, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 33, <hi>If his Children forſake my Law, and walk not in my Judgments: Nevertheleſs my loving-kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> Jer. 31.34, <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and will remember their ſin no more.</hi> 1.

               <p>The fifth part of the Mediators work in executing this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is to bring all thoſe whom he hath engaged by this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to the height of that bleſſedneſs which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them, that as a Captain of Salvation he might <hi>bring many Sons to glory,</hi> Heb. 2.10, which ſtandeth in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and glorious conformity with Chriſt, and in perfect and glorious communion with God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2, <hi>But we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> For accompliſhing whereof, Chriſt in executing the Mediators Office, 1.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the grounds of Comfort and ſupports of Faith, ariſing to Believers from Chriſts Mediatorſhip.</head>
               <p>I Shall ſhut up this part of the Doctrine of Chriſts Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip with ſome grounds of Comfort, and ſupports of Faith, which ariſe thence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is Comfort here, and ſupport for Faith to all who are convinced of enmity betwixt God and them, and do deſire reconciliation with him: Lo here are glad tidings, there is a Mediator, a Peace-maker betwixt God and men. 1 He is already long ago deſigned and appointed for this Office. 2. He hath already done the work, he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and proclaimed the Peace, even to Rebels who will come in and accept of it; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.16, 17, <hi>And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the Croſs, having ſlain the enmity thereby; and came and preached Peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh:</hi> and being now remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of our ſight, he hath appointed it to be done by his meſſengers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15, <hi>How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of Peace, and bring glad tidings of good things?</hi> 3. He is now ready to accept of, and make interceſſion for all thoſe that ſhall come in and declare their acceptance of his offer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them:</hi> Joh. 6.37, <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Why then do you haeſitate? Why ſtand you off? What aileth you? Is there not here encouragement and ſupport of Faith? Is there not comfort againſt the ſelt-enmity and feared-wrath to come? <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the Sin of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:58137:149"/>2. There is comfort, and ſupport for Faith from Chriſts Mediatorſhip, namely to Believers, and to thoſe who have come to God through him. 1. To all forts of Believers. 2. In all the variety of their ſeveral conditions. 3. Againſt all their fears and evils wherewith they are afflicted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To all Believers, I mean ſound Believers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1, to the weak as well as the ſtrong, to them who have <hi>like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Faith</hi> with the Apoſtles, although they have not like perfect and ſtrong Faith: he is not a Mediator for the ſtrong only, but for all that believe on him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> And 17.20, <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo that ſhall believe on me through their word.</hi>

                  </gap>om <hi>Heb.</hi> 17.25, that the comfort and encouragement propoſed there from Chriſts Interceſſion, is fitted for a Recumbents Faith: the proper act whereof, as 'tis diſtinguiſhed from the Faith of Aſſurance, is a coming to Chriſt: he is a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for all that have caſt themſelves on him in their way of coming to God, though their Faith be not yet grown up to aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To all Believers in their ſeveral conditions he is Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and does the Office of a Mediator, not only when Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers can act faith, and employ him; but when their Faith is well-near failed, like a worn week, when they are at the weakeſt, and at the worſt: <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32, <hi>But I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not.</hi> Not only when his elect people are doing him ſervice; but when they are ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſing him, as many times they do, eſpecially before their Converſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.5, 6, <hi>I am Jeſus whom thou perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt.—And he trembling and aſtoniſhed ſaid, Lord what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord ſaid, ariſe and go into the City, and it ſhall be told thee what thou muſt do.</hi> Luke 23.34, <hi>And Jeſus ſaid, Father forgive them for they know not what they do.</hi> Not only when they are in his way, but when they are out of the way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2, <hi>Who can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way.</hi> Not only when they can pray, and wreſtle for
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:58137:150"/>themſelves, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3, <hi>And another Angel came and ſtood at the Altar, having a Golden Cenſor, and there was given unto him much Incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of all Saints upon the Golden Altar which was before the Throne:</hi> but when they cannot utter their heart before the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27, <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf maketh Interceſſion for us with groanings that cannot be uttered. And he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh Interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God.</hi> Iſa. 59.16, <hi>And he ſaw that there was no man, and wondred that there was no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor: therefore his arm brought ſalvation unto him, and his righteouſneſs it ſustained him.</hi> Not only when all is well, and at peace, and when nothing is charged againſt them; but when they are under Challenges, and condemning-things are laid to their charge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth: who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> Not only in time of peace, but when wrath and deſtruction is gone forth againſt his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, Go through the midst of the City, the midſt of Jeruſalem, and ſet a mark upon the foreheads of the men that ſigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midſt thereof.</hi> Zech. 1.12, <hi>Then the Angel of the Lord anſwered and ſaid, O Lord of Hoſts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and on the Cities of Judah, against which thou haſt had indignation theſe Threeſcore and ten years?</hi> Not only at their firſt coming, but in all their after-addreſſes to God through him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them:</hi> With 4.14, 16, <hi>Seeing then that we have an High-prieſt that is paſſed into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need.</hi>

                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:58137:150"/>3. The Comfort and ſupport of Faith flowing from Chriſts Mediatorſhip, reacheth to all the evils wherewith Believers can be afflicted. Namely, 1. It may comfort againſt the daily infirmities wherewith believers are compaſſed; theſe ſhall not make a breach betwixt God and us, for as much as Chriſts Mediation is intended to prevent that, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2, <hi>And if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> 2. Againſt the many challenges, whether of an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-conſcience, or of the great accuſer of the Brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifieth who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us.</hi> 3. Againſt the more foul and groſs ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Believers, for as much as it is alſo intended for the helping of theſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 32, <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.</hi> 4. Againſt the fear of their falling away from the bleſſed Covenant-ſtate, with which fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have often been buffeted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.</hi> And 17.5, <hi>Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my foot-ſteps ſlip not.</hi> It is by Chriſt Mediation that we have eſtabliſhment in Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39, <hi>And this is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day.</hi> Rom. 5.10, <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled, to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi> 5. Againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold afflictions wherewith Believers are toſſed here: the Mediator was ſometimes an afflicted man, and went through much ſuffering, and hath the feeling of theſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3, 7, <hi>A man of ſorrow, and accquainted with grief—He was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and he was afflicted: Pſal.</hi> 22 throughout. 6. Againſt the many temptations of all kinds which occaſion much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs to Believers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, <hi>Ye are in heavineſs through manifold temptations.</hi> The Mediator had the experience of all ſorts of temptations, and now ſympathizeth with his people
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:58137:151"/>like condition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18, <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> And 4.15, <hi>For we have not an High-prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are; yet without ſin.</hi> 7. Againſt the empty and needy condition unto which Believers are ſubject, through the manifold wants wherewith they are daily preſſed: We have confidence through the Mediator, to come-ſpeed in every petition that is acceptable to God, and profitable to us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14, 15, <hi>And this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear us, whatſoever we ask; we know that we have the petitions that we deſired of him.</hi> Joh. 14.13, <hi>And whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</hi> 8. Againſt the fear of death, which is terrible to nature: <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.25, <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto her, I am the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 15.26, <hi>The laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, is Death.</hi> Job 19.25, <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall stand at the latter day upon the Earth.</hi> Joh. 17.2, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> 9. Againſt the ſecond appearing of Chriſt (which is ſometimes terrible without cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers) and the laſt Judgment that ſhall be given, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the everlaſting intereſts of the creatures: the Man Chriſt, whom you have owned for your Mediator, ſhall ſit as Judg, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30, 31, <hi>And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men every where to repent: Becauſe he hath appointed a day in the which he will judg the world in righteouſneſs, by that man whom he hath ordained.</hi> 2 Theſ. 7.10, <hi>And to you who are troubled, reſt with us—When he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints.</hi> Then ſhall he perform a comfortable act of his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 24, <hi>Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to preſent you faultleſs before the preſence of his glory, with exceeding joy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:58137:151"/>
               <p>And there is good ground for all Believers to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted from Chriſts Mediatorſhip, if we conſider, 1. The perſon who Mediates. 2. The Perſon with whom he Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diates. 3. The Perſons for whom he Mediates. 4. The cauſe for which he Mediates.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Perſon who Mediates: Conſider, 1. His Graciouſneſs with his Father, O ſo great a Courtier with God as the Mediator is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.41, 42, <hi>Father I thank thee, that thou haſt heard me. And I knew that thou heareſt me alwayes:</hi> and no wonder he be ſo, being his Son, <hi>his only begotten Son,</hi> Joh. 1.18. His <hi>beloved Son,</hi> Matth. 3.17. His <hi>obedient Son,</hi> Phil. 2.8. 2. His Greatneſs and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power to do of himſelf whatſoever he Mediates for with his Father. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth.</hi> Joh. 5.21, 23, 26, 27, <hi>For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickneth them; even ſo the Son quickneth whom he will: That all men ſhould ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Son, even as they honour the Father: He that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth not the Son honoureth not the Father that ſent him. For as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf. And Hath given him autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to execute Judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of Man.</hi> Therefore he is called a <hi>Prieſt upon a Throne;</hi> a Prieſt who is a King, to command whatſoever he prayes for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and 8.1, <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.13. 3. The oneneſs of his will with his Fathers, which maketh ſure the prevalency of his Mediation, being ſure to ask nothing but what is his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will; and all that he asks being his Fathers will as much as his; how can it be ineffectual? <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24, <hi>Father I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The Perſon with whom he Mediates: Conſider 1. His nearneſs of relation both to the Mediator, and to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for whom he Mediates: He is Chriſts Father, and our Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.17, <hi>But go to my brethren and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:58137:152"/>your God.</hi> 2. His graciouſneſs and affection both to Chriſt and to us; he loveth Chriſt, and he loveth us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that he is as inclinable to hear Chriſt for his people, as Chriſt is to mediate for them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.26, 27. <hi>At that day ye ſhall ask in my name, and I ſay unto you, that I will pray the Father for you. For the Father himſelf loveth you, becauſe ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Perſons for whom he Mediates: Conſider, 1. Our nearneſs of alliance with the Mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11, 14, 17, <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied are all one: for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them Brethren. For as much then as the Children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame—Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſins of the people.</hi> Joh. 17.23, <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> 2. Our nearneſs to God through Chriſt the Mediator, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18, <hi>And I will be a father unto you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters ſaith the Lord God Almighty,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 6. ver. 17, <hi>But he that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. In the Cauſe for which he Mediates: Conſider, 1. The Righteouſneſs thereof; Chriſt having now ſatisfied Juſtice, and his cauſe being juſtified, he hath a ſtrong plea in Law and Juſtice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10, <hi>Who ſhall alſo confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the ſeveral Relations which Chriſt ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Covenant of Grace: and, <hi>1.</hi> Chriſt <hi>a witneſs to the People.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is not eaſie to find out and determine all Chriſts relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Covenant of Grace; they are ſo many and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, that I know not whether to ſay, that Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ſeem to exhauſt the total of the Covenant; or that the compend and ſum of the Covenant is comprized in his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he ſuſtaineth in it. I ſuppoſe there is a truth in both; for whatſoever is neceſſarily related to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is in him, whether it be Parties, Articles, Promiſes, Conditions, Confirmations, Witneſs, Mediator, Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp;c. and in him is to be found the whole Covenant, therefore he is called <hi>the Covenant</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. &amp; 49.8.</p>
               <p>Chriſt hath ſeveral relations to the Covenant:<note place="margin">See <hi>Mr. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therf.</hi> trial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Triumph of ſaith. <hi>p. 1. c. 7.</hi>
                  </note> 1. He is a Party Covenanting. 2. He is Mediator of the Covenant. 3. He is the witneſs of the Covenant. 4. He is the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Covenant. 5. He is a Servant in the Covenant. 6. He is the Surety of the Covenant. 7. He is the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. 8. He is the Covenant it ſelf.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak nothing here of the firſt two relations, how Chriſt is a ſide, or the one half of the Covenant; nor how he ſtandeth as a middle perſon between the diſagreeing Parties. But for theſe I refer to that I have ſaid of the Parties co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting, and of the Mediator of the Covenant; only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed to ſpeak of theſe other relations, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe theſe few things, as being of common uſe for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the whole relations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whatſoever relations Chriſt beareth in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he was from Eternity choſen and deſigned unto thoſe in the counſel of God, and by an everlaſting Decree, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7, <hi>I will declare the decree, the Lord hath ſaid unto me, thou art
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:58137:154"/>my ſon, this day have I begotten thee;</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Whatſoever relations Chriſt ſuſtaineth in the Covenant, he doth it by voluntary diſpenſation, and not by any natural neceſſity or compulſion: that he is a Party contracting, or that he is Mediator, or that he is Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Covenant, &amp;c. nothing could compel Chriſt to put his name in any of theſe relations, it was all of conſent; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, <hi>But made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men.</hi> Heb. 10.9, <hi>Then ſaid he, L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> I come to do thy will, O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, All theſe relations which Chriſt ſuſtaineth in the Covenant, are all acts of Grace, both upon Gods part, who deſigned Chriſt unto theſe relations, that he might act Grace in Chriſt as the firſt copy of Free-grace, and that we might ſhare with him; and alſo upon Chriſts part, who could not be hired to undertake theſe relations, knowing what they would coſt him; but the Free-grace of his own heart engaged him in theſe relations: 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.21, <hi>According to thine own heart haſt thou done all theſe great things.</hi> Rom. 8.32, <hi>How ſhall he not with him alſo, freely give us all things?</hi> with <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20, <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though in the Covenant of Grace Chriſt be diſpenſed in all his offices, and and the efficacy and fruit of all theſe offices, as appeareth from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4, with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32, and <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34; yet ſome of his relations which he ſuſtaineth in the Covenant, do more eſpecially reſpect one of his offices, and ſome another; as alſo ſome of them directly reſpect all his offices: Take for inſtances, His relation as Mediator, reſpecteth all his offices: His relation as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty contracting, reſpecteth all his offices, wherein he was a publick perſon, who did repreſent many: His relation as Surety doth eſpecially relate to his Kngly office, in regard of which he was undertaker, and made potent to help, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19. His relations as Witneſs, Meſſenger, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, doth reſpect eſpecially his prophetical office: His relation as Teſtator, reſpecteth eſpecially his Prieſtly office, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Whatſoever relations Chriſt ſuſtaineth in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58137:154"/>of grace, he beareath all theſe relations by Covenant, and by explicite contract he hath undertaken them; ſo that as we ſay of his offices, he was a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.3, <hi>I have made a Covenant with my choſen; I have ſworn unto David my ſervant:</hi> We ſay the ſame of all his relations in reſpect of the Covenant. He is by Covenant and Compact with God, by the Covenant of Suretiſhip, whatſoever he is in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-relations. He is by Covenant, Mediator of the Covenant: He is by Covenant, a Party in the Covenant, repreſenting others. He is by a Covenant, the Witneſs, Meſſenger, Servant, Surety, Teſtator of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. &amp; 53.10, 11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10, 12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2, 6, 12, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, For whomſoever he beareth any of theſe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Covenant, for them he beareth them all; if he be for, and unto any perſons, Mediator to God-ward, he hath engaged as party contracting with God for ſuch perſons; he is become Surety for ſuch, he hath and ſhall be Witneſs, Meſſenger and Servant, for promoting and manifeſting the things of this Covenant unto ſuch; he hath teſted in his Legacy things pertaining to ſuch perſons, &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. &amp; 53.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17, throughout.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to the third relation which Chriſt ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Covenant of Grace; he is the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4, <hi>Behold, I have given him for a witneſs to the people.</hi> Rev. 3.14, <hi>Theſe thing ſaith the Amen, the faithful and true witneſs.</hi> Rev. 1.5, <hi>And from Jeſus Chriſt, who is the faithful witneſs.</hi> Chriſt may be conſidered as the witneſs of the Covenant in a double reſpect. 1. He is the <hi>Witneſs witneſſed.</hi> 2. He is the <hi>Witneſs wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing.</hi> The Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Ghned</hi> is rendred, and doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſignifie <hi>Teſtimonium,</hi> as well as <hi>Teſtis;</hi> and ſo the LXX render it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.—Chriſt is the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium</hi> and the <hi>Teſtis,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.14; <hi>Write, theſe things ſaith the Amen, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true witneſs;</hi> with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6, <hi>Who gave himſelf a ranſome for all, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> Firſt, I ſay Chriſt is the <hi>Witneſs witneſſed,</hi> or the great evidence and teſtimony of the Covenant betwixt God and his people, (and in this ſenſe a Witneſs is uſed frequently in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſignifie not only a perſon that beareth teſtimony,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:58137:155"/>but for any thing that doth evidence as a witneſs. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4, <hi>By which he obtained witneſs, that he was righteous; God teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his gifts.</hi> Luk. 22.71, <hi>And they ſaid, what need we any further witneſs, for we our ſelves have heard of his own mouth</hi>)? For, Firſt, He is given of God as the great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Covenant-love, and of that ſpecial good-will to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which gave the firſt riſe to the Covenant, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſon, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Luk. 2.10, 11, <hi>And the Angel ſaid unto them, fear not; for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people; for unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> Secondly, He is given as the great evidence of Covenant-intereſt, and relations betwixt God and ſinners, as the ſign and evidence that the diſagreeing parties are made one in him: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14, <hi>Therefore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a ſign: Behold, a virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name Immanuel.</hi> Thirdly, As the great evidence and witneſs of Gods fulfilling all the promiſes of the Covenant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20, <hi>For all the promiſes of God in him are Yea, and in him they are Amen;</hi> therefore Chriſt was of old given as the ſign of fulfilling all promiſes, and accompliſhing all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveries to the Church before his coming in the fleſh. <hi>Zech.</hi> 6.12, <hi>and he ſhall build the temple of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 7.14. Fourthly, As the great evidence and witneſs of the ſtanding-perpetuity of theſe Covenant-relations betwixt God and his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.34, 35, 37, <hi>My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I ſworn by my holineſs, that I will not lye unto David. It ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever as the moon: and as a faithful witneſs in heaven. Selah.</hi> Fifthly, As the great evidence of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and complexion of the Covenant, he is ſo given of God for a witneſs, that all the Covenant is compriſed in him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, <hi>And will give thee for a Covenant of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for a light of the Gentiles:</hi> and therefore alſo when it was firſt revealed, there was nothing heard of but this witneſs Chriſt, in the promiſe of whom all the Covenant, the union of God and man, was ſimmed up, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15, <hi>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:58137:155"/>thy ſeed and her ſeed; it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Chriſt be given to the people for a witneſs in this ſenſe; then, 1. You who are under the Preaching of this Goſpel, <hi>qua faedus anunciatum,</hi> conſider the office of Chriſt, and underſtand it as the great witneſs and evidence of Gods commanding and approving will, that you ſhould enter in Covenant with him, and that you ought to believe on the Son of God; and know for a certainty, that if you obey not the command of believing and taking hold of this Covenant, the offers of Chriſt that hath been made unto you, ſhall be for a witneſs and evidence that ſhall acquit the Lord of your condemnation, and ſhall cut off all excuſe from you, in as much as your Obligation and Duty to believe, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto you, and the offer of Chriſt is the witneſs of this, to all the people who have heard the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23, <hi>And this is his commandment, that we ſhould believe in the name of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Joh. 15.25, <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin: but now they have no cloak for their ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſuch as have the Covenant of grace acted in an effectual and powerful way upon their hearts, according to Gods Decree and Will of purpoſe; I mean, ſuch as have been brought under <hi>the bond of this Covenant</hi> upon their hearts, <hi>Eze.</hi> 20.37, in which ſenſe the Covenant is ſpoken of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31, and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36, &amp;c. I would have you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Gods giving of Chriſt unto you, as he doth intend it, to wit, as a witneſs and teſtimony of his Covenant with you, as the greateſt evidence and demonſtration that can be of his Covenant-love to you, of your Covenant-intereſt in him, of the continuance of that Covenant-relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and him, and of the nature and ſubſtance of that Covenant: you fearch for witneſſes within you, and from Heaven, to teſtifie of your Covenant-ſtate through grace; you long for that which may evidence it ſatisfyingly unto you (and it may be moſt of us ſin more on the other hand, through neglect of fearching after theſe witneſſes which are attainable); but it's a pity that believers who have received Chriſt freely given to them by God, ſhould ſlight the greateſt witneſs that ever God gave to his people; a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:58137:156"/>is at hand, and you receive not the teſtimony thereof: it may of this be ſaid, <hi>He that believeth on the ſon of God hath the witneſs in himſelf,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.10, 11, 12. He hath Chriſt the great witneſs of the Covenant; and who knows but we may be left of God to wander the more in the dark, about our Covenant ſtate, becauſe we lay ſo little weight upon the having of him whom God hath <hi>given for a witneſs to the people?</hi> O let us not tempt God by ſlighting him thus; but let us look upon the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him given to us, as the witneſs of all theſe things before-mentioned, concerning a Covenant betwixt God and us, he being given of God for this end; ſo may we find the door and way which we grope for, how to be eſtabliſhed in the faith of our Covenant-relation to God.</p>
               <p>But I come to ſpeak of the ſecond, which I take to be chiefly meant, Chriſt is the <hi>Witneſs witneſſing,</hi> or the perſon who beareth witneſs of all that is contained in the Covenant: For opening of this, conſider theſe four particulars. Chriſt is the <hi>Beholding</hi>-witneſs, the <hi>Acting</hi>-witneſs, the <hi>Declaring</hi>-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the <hi>Confirming</hi>-witneſs of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt is an <hi>Eye-witneſs</hi> of the Covenant; that is, he was preſent, and heard and ſaw the whole tranſaction of the Covenant, from the beginning to the end; in which reſpect the Scriptures call perſons preſent at any thing, and beholders of it, witneſſes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. &amp; 2.22. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2, 3, becauſe they are fit to bear witneſs in that thing, having certain grounds of knowledg of it: Thus was our Lord Jeſus a fit witneſs of the Covenant, for he was preſent at the very firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and heard and ſaw all the convey of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, 23, 30, <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning; or ever the earth was, then I was by him, as one brought up with him; and I was dayly his delight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing always before him.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9, <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began.</hi> So that we may ſay of him in reference to the Covenant-tranſaction, that which <hi>John</hi> ſaith of him with reference to creation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2, 3, <hi>The ſame was in the beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58137:156"/>that was made.</hi> Nothing was done in that buſineſs without him, neither indeed could it be, he being not only preſent, but the alone party with whom God had firſt dealing with reference to this Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt is an <hi>Acting-witneſs</hi> of the Covenant, who not only was preſent, and did-ſee the whole tranſaction of that buſineſs; but had an active hand in it; yea it was acted upon his perſon, when <hi>before Pontius Pilate he witneſſed a good confeſſion,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.13: and in this ſenſe it is that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 5, calleth himſelf a <hi>Witneſs of the ſufferings of Chriſt:</hi> becauſe he had experience of them in his own perſon; he was partaker of them, and had them acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. 'Tis beyond queſtion, that Chriſt was ſuch a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Covenant, he had an active hand in it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end, in the making of it, and in the fulfilling of it; he was a prime actor and undertaker from eternity. Hence it is that the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11, aſcribes the making of the new Covenant, to Chriſt; for its of him and his Miniſtry that the Apoſtle ſpeaks in that place; ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2, 6, &amp;c. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him. I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world: Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me; and they have kept thy word,</hi> Joh. 15.15: <hi>for all things that I have heard of my father, I have made known unto you:</hi> yea, I ſay the whole Covenant was acted upon him, the union of the contrary diſagreeing parties was acted upon his perſon; the bringing of man near to God, and Gods coming near to man; the paying of the ranſome, and the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, it was acted upon him; it was a bloody act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his perſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53, throughout. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.7, <hi>Awake, O ſword, againſt my ſhepherd, and againſt the man that is my fellow, ſaith the Lord of hoſts; ſmite the ſhepherd.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10, <hi>To wit, that God, was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt is the witneſs of the Covenant, who did <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> and reveal the great ſecret of the Covenant, even all that he heard, and faw, and acted about it; he doth witneſs and declare even the whole Counſel of God concerning his Covenant, his purpoſe and will of grace concerning his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:58137:157"/>which things we had never known, had not the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Covenant revealed and declared them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14, <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him: and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> Joh. 1.18, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time: the only begotten ſon which is in the boſome of the father, he hath declared him.</hi> Eph. 2.17, <hi>And came and preached peace to you which were afar off: and to them that were near.</hi> The reaſon is manifeſt, becauſe Natures light, which can ſhew ſomething of God, yet it's utterly blind concerning Chriſt and the Covenant of grace. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 8, 12. <hi>But we ſpeak the wiſdom of God in a myſtery, even the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wiſdom which God ordained before the world, unto our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which none of the princes of this world knew: For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.

It is a controverſie to believers, whether they ſhall ever be Victorious over their Luſts, and prevail againſt their temptations, when they ſeel the ſtrength and working of corruption in themſelves, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14, 15, <hi>But I am carnal, ſold under ſin: For that which Ido, I allow not: for what I would, that I do not, but what I hate, that I do.</hi> Many a time they utter that language, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.18, <hi>And I ſaid, my ſtrength and my hope is periſhed from the Lord.</hi> But the Witneſs of the Covenant teſtifieth in this alſo, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the controverſie in their favours, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.4, <hi>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: becauſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is he that is in you, then he that is in the world.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4, 5, <hi>For whatſoever is born of God, overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith: who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God?</hi> Rom. 16.20, <hi>And the God of peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your feet ſhortly.</hi> 7. It is a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to doubting-believers, whether they ſhall perſevere to the end, or ſhall not rather fall away finally. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence: and take not thy holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from me.</hi> But Chriſt hath decided the controverſie, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12, <hi>Thoſe that thou gaveſt me, I have kept, and none of them is loſt, but the ſon of perdition.</hi> Joh. 10.28. <hi>And I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand.</hi> Joh. 14.19, <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> 8. It is a controverſie to the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-believer, whether it be good for him to be ſo dealt with, to be afflicted, deſerted, tempted, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.9, <hi>I will ſay unto my God, my rock, why haſt thou forgotten me? why go I mourning becauſe of the oppreſſion of the enemy?</hi> Pſal. 73.13, 14, <hi>Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my hands in Innocency. For all the day long I have been plagued, and chaſtened every morning.</hi> Chriſt hath decided this controverſie alſo, not by his verdict only of the matter, but by his Witneſs in his peoples hearts, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7, <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. This Covenant-relation of Chriſts, layeth grounds of comfort to believers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That you want not a <hi>Witneſs</hi> to teſtifie unto you concerning all things which are dark and doubtful, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4, <hi>Behold, I have given him for a witneſs to the people.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.8, 9, 10, <hi>And there are three that bear witneſs in earth, the ſpirit, and the water, and the blood, and theſe three agree in one. If we receive the witneſs of men, the witneſs of God is greater: for this is the witneſs of God, which he hath teſtified of his Son: He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witneſs in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: he that believeth not God, hath made him a lyar, becauſe he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.</hi> So that if you be doubtful, and in the dark about any thing pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God and to the matters of your Salvation, you know how to have that witneſſed and plainly made out unto you, by Chriſt the Witneſs of the Covenant; and if you continue under your doubting, blame your ſelves, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, <hi>And I give thee for a Covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another ground of comfort, reſulting from this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-relation, is, that we not only have a Witneſs, but that we have <hi>ſuch a Witneſs, him for a Witneſs;</hi> that God
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58137:167"/>who might have given us other witneſſes, and have denyed this Witneſs, hath given him for a Witneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2, <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in times paſt unto the fathers by the Prophets; hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom he alſo made the worlds.</hi> Act. 14.17, <hi>Nevertheleſs, he left not himſelf without witneſs, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſs.</hi> So fit a Witneſs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2, 3, who heard and ſaw, and acted all the buſineſs of the Covenant, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, to 32. So ſaithful a Witneſs, that will not lye, that cannot lye, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. and 3.14. So great a Witneſs, a perſon of ſuch Authority, being God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.35. So compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Witneſs, who can pity his doubting-people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2. So condeſcending a Witneſs, who can ſtoop to teach and perſwade the weaklings of the people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.39, as all his carriage did prove, while he was upon the earth: So convincing a Witneſs, whoſe teſtimony can put an end to all ſtrife, if he will only ſpeak the word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.8. And all this is for the ſtronger conſolation of Believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18, <hi>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe, the immutability of his counſel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by an oath: That by two immutabile things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have a ſtrong conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Another ground of comfort which this relation afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to believers, is, That Chriſt is by office a Witneſs, and that he is a Witneſs by Covenant: <hi>i. e.</hi> not only doth the office which is upon him, bind this upon him; but by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and voluntary condeſcenſion, he is engaged, and hath conſented to be a Witneſs to the people: therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>Behold I have given him for a witneſs,</hi> Iſa. 55.4. And he ſaith, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will,</hi> Heb. 10.9. This is your comfort, Believers, that Chriſt is a Witneſs by office and Covenant, and can no more deny to teſtifie unto you the things pertaining to the Covenant, than ye can deny his office, or break his Covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another ground of comfort in this Covenant-relation,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:58137:167"/>is, that he is given for <hi>a witneſs to the people:</hi> I mean, that whatſoever belongs to him by this office and relation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Witneſs, and whatſoever he is by vertue thereof, that he is; and that he performeth to all the people of God without exception or reſpect of perſons, what he hath been in his way of witneſſing, and what he hath teſtified and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to others of the people of God; inſomuch that he hath ſetled, quieted and comforted them, by doing the part of a Witneſs, to reveal and to prove unto them, things about which they doubted, concerning their Covenant-ſtate, and his Covenant-love; that ſame he will do to thee and to any of his people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22, <hi>Even the righteouſneſs of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: for there is no difference.</hi> Gal. 3.28, <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Act. 10.34, <hi>Then Peter opened his mouth, and ſaid, of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpector of perſons.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.3, <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>THE fourth relation which Chriſt beareth in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, is, That he is <hi>the Meſſenger of the Covenant.</hi> Mal. 3.1, <hi>The Lord whom ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his temple, even the Meſſenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in.</hi> That this is ſpoken and meant of Chriſt, is acknowledged both by Chriſtian and Jewiſh Interpreters: It is alſo clear from the Text, that it can be meant of no other for the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Covenant is he, before whom <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was ſent a Meſſenger to prepare the way, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1, <hi>Behold,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:58137:168"/>I will ſend my Meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me. Luk.</hi> 7.27, <hi>This is he of whom it is written, behold, I ſend my Meſſenger before thy face, which ſhall prepare thy way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</hi> Luk. 1.76, <hi>And thou Child ſhall be called the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Higheſt: for thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his ways.</hi> This is he who is the Lord, whom the people ſeek, and in whom they delight; he whoſe coming was much longed and looked for, by the people of God: this is he who ſitteth as a refiner, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. Now this can be no other but Chriſt: compare this with <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.25, 38. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8.</p>

               <p>For the better underſtanding of this relation which Chriſt fuſtaineth in the Covenant: We ſhall ſhortly hold forth, 1. What the name Meſſenger or Angel of the Covenant doth import, as to the nature of the thing. 2. In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects it is applicable to Chriſt. 3. Betwixt what parties he is a Meſſenger. 4. Whoſe Meſſenger he is; of one of theſe parties, or of both. 5. In what buſineſs he is a Meſſenger. 6. Somewhat of the properties of this Meſſenger of the Covenant, which commend his travelling in this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
               <p>And 1. the name Meſſenger or Angel doth import, 1. A delegation or Truſt: a Meſſenger is a Truſtee; it is a name of office or imployment, and doth neceſſarily import a Miſſion; therefore it is often joyned with ſending, See <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold, I will ſend my meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me.</hi> Mat. 11.10, <hi>Behold, I ſend my meſſenger before thy face.</hi> 1 Kings 19.2, <hi>Then Jezzebel ſent a meſſenger
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:58137:168"/>unto Elijah, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. If it be asked, unto which of Chriſts offices doth this name relate? I anſwer, it doth in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect relate to all his offices, becauſe his Meſſage is as large as his Miſſion and Unction, which includeth all his offices; but it doth more eſpecially relate to his Prophetical and Prieſtly Office, becauſe in regard of theſe mainly, he travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led betwixt the parties, and carried Meſſages and Reports hither and thither. 2. This name of Meſſenger doth import a ſubordination or ſubjection, in regard that he who ſendeth, is greater than he who is ſent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.16, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, the Servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is ſent, greater then he that ſent him.</hi> Mat. 8.9, <hi>For I am a man under Authority, having ſoldiers under me: and I ſay to this man, go, and he goeth: and to another, come, and he cometh: and to my ſervant, do this, and he doth it.</hi> And therefore it muſt be underſtood of Chriſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his diſpenſatory employment and voluntary conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, whereby he humbled himſelf to travel in the work of Redemption, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2, <hi>And took upon him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</hi> 3. This name of Meſſenger of the Covenant, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port on the part of a Meſſenger, a travelling betwixt the parties of the Covenant, betwixt him who ſendeth Chriſt, and theſe to whom he is ſent, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> Joh. 16.28, <hi>I came forth from the father, and am come into the world: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I leave the world, and go to the father.</hi> Joh. 14.2. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> 4. This name imports corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence and intercourſe betwixt the parties, through the Meſſenger, and by his means and travel, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.22, 23, 25, <hi>So the meſſenger went, and came and ſhewed David all that Joab had ſent him for. And the Meſſenger ſaid unto David, ſurely the men prevailed againſt us: Then David ſaid unto the meſſenger, thus ſhalt thou ſay unto Joab, let not this thing diſpleaſe thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6, 8, <hi>I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world: and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider next, in what reſpects the name <hi>Meſſenger</hi> is applicable to Chriſt with relation to the Covenant. 1. In

               <p n="2">2. This-name of Meſſenger of the Covenant, is applicable to him in regard of his pains and travel in the matters of the Covenant: I mean, in regard of his work as well as his truſt; and thus in regard of ſeveral pieces of his work and travel, he may be called the Meſſenger of the Covenant: 1. He is the Meſſenger who carried the Meſſage of a new Covenant, who travelled from Heaven to Earth with this Meſſage, to make a Covenant betwixt God and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; he came expreſly for this one errant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, <hi>But when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.6, <hi>This is he that came by water and blood, even Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, not by water only, but by water and blood.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.5, <hi>This then is the meſſage which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all.</hi> And in this ſenſe the word is frequently uſed for an Expreſs, or one ſent for a particular Errant and purpoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6, 7, <hi>There was a man ſent from God, whoſe name was John

                     </gap> is he of whom it is written, Behold, I ſend my meſſenger before thy face, which ſhall prepare thy way before thee.</hi> 2. He is the Meſſenger who did publiſh and intimate the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Gods gracious purpoſe in it, as that thing which was his errant in the World, he did it Authoritatively, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers only Miniſterially, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20, <hi>Now then we are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, he ye reconciled to God.</hi> He is the chief Miniſter of the new Teſtament, others only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord God as upon me, becauſe the Lord hath annointed me to preach good ridings unto the meek,</hi> Heb. 8.2, 6, 10, <hi>A miniſter of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched, and not man. But now hath he obtained a more excellent mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, by how much alſo he is the mediator of a better Covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes. For this is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, after thoſe days ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.9.11, <hi>Now that he aſcended, what is it, but that he alſo deſcended firſt into the lower parts of the earth? and he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> Luk. 19.10, Eph. 2.17. Pov. 9.1, 3. So the word is taken for one that intimateth or bringeth word, and giveth notice of any thing, <hi>Joh</hi> 1.14. 3. He is the Meſſenger who doth interpret and declare the Meſſage of the new Covenant, who travelleth to be an Interpreter of the mind of God in that matter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27, <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my father: and no man knoweth the Son but the father: neither knoweth any man the father ſave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him.</hi> Joh. 1.18, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time: the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son which is in the beſome of the father, he hath declared him.</hi> Rom. 3.25, 26. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, through Faith in his blood, to declare his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God.

He is the meſſenger, which acteth the Covenant upon the hearts of his people, <hi>effective &amp; phyſice,</hi> I mean, the Meſſenger which attacheth the hearts of his people (as a Serjeant at Arms, that layeth hands upon a man) and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them into the bond of the Covenant: the Meſſenger that never leaveth purſuit until he hath apprehended, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.37, <hi>And I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant.</hi> Heb. 8.10, <hi>For this is the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord: I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.</hi> Hoſ. 2.19, <hi>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in mercies.</hi> Ezek. 36, 27, <hi>And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments, and do them.</hi> Joh. 6.29, 37, <hi>Jeſus anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid unto them, this is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.

He is the meſſenger which reporteth the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the tranſactions with every Soul that receiveth this Goſpel, where, and with whom the treaty took effect; and where, and with whom the propoſal of the Covenant halted, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6, 7, 8, <hi>I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world: thine they were; and thou gaveſt them me; and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that all things whatſoever thou haſt given me, are of thee. For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.</hi> So the word is uſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.6, <hi>And the meſſengers returned to Jacob, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Betwixt whom doth Chriſt travel as Meſſenger of the Covernant? For a right underſtanding of this, we are to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:58137:170"/>make uſe of theſe two neceſſary diſtinctions: 1. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant may be conſidered, either as it's preached and offered generally to all who hear it, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46, 47, <hi>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed hold, and ſaid, it was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken unto you: but ſeeing ye put it from you, and judg your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life. Lo, we turn to the Gentiles. For ſo hath the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, ſaying, I have ſet thee to be a light of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that thou ſhouldſt be for ſalvation unto the ends of the earth.</hi> Mark. 16.15, <hi>And he ſaid unto them, go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel unto every creature:</hi> Or it may be conſidered, as it is acted, and effectually fulfilled upon the hearts of the Elect, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48, <hi>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.</hi> Heb. 8. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 2. This different conſideration of the Covenant, affords a diſtinction of the parties in the Covenant: the parties contracting in the Covenant preached, are God, and all within the viſible Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25, <hi>Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, ſaying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Abraham, And in thy ſeed ſhall all the kindreds of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Act. 2.39, 40, <hi>For the promiſe is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off; even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> But the parties contracting in the Covenant, conſidered in that ſecond reſpect, as 'tis acted upon hearts, are only the elect people, upon whoſe hearts the law is written, and in whom God hath put his ſpirit, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, <hi>But this ſhall be the covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael; after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> Ezek. 36.27, <hi>And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments, and do them.</hi> Theſe things premiſed for clearing the point in hand, I lay down four Concluſions: 1. Chriſt is in ſome reſpect a Meſſenger betwixt God and all the viſible multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to whom the Covenant is offered, and the Goſpel preached; therefore it's ſaid of him, <hi>That he is given for a light to the Gentiles, and for a witneſs to the people, even to nations,</hi> Iſa. 49.6. &amp; 55.4, 5. Rom. 15.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. I ſaid
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:58137:171"/>in ſome reſtect; becauſe he did procure the Goſpel to be preached to all narions, and doth carry the Meſſage of the Covenant to multitudes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18, <hi>But I ſay, have they not heard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> yes verity, their ſound went into all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world.</hi> 2. Chriſt is in a more ſpecial reſpect, Meſſenger betwixt God and his few choſen people, becauſe he hath a Meſſage from God to act upon their hearts, that which is only externally revealed, commanded and offered unto others; and he hath undertaken for them, and for their receiving the Meſſage which he carrieth unto them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, 39, <hi>All that the father giveth we, ſhall come to me. And this is the fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day.</hi> Joh. 17.6, 8, <hi>I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world: thine they were; and thou gaveſt them me; and they have kept thy word. For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.</hi> Act. 13.26, <hi>And whoſoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſent.</hi> 3. Chriſt is a Meſſenger of the Covenant to many Hypocrites and Reprobates unto whom he bringeth the offer and Meſſage of the Covenant; not for their ſake and cauſe, but for the Elects ſake, with whom they are mixed here in ſocieties upon the earth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15, <hi>For all things are for your ſakes, that the abundant grace might, through the thankſgiving of many, redound to the glory of God.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.10, <hi>Therefore I endure all things for the elects ſakes, that they may alſo obtain the ſalvation which is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, with eternal glory.</hi> So that the Meſſage of the Covenant is preached to them by way of concomitancy, in reſpect that they are in theſe ſocieties, unto which the Goſpel is ſent for ſalvation to the Elect, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.18, 19, 21, <hi>As thou haſt ſent me into the world, even ſo alſo have I ſent them into the world. And for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo might be ſanctified through the truth. That they all may be one, as thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> 4. Chriſt is a Meſſenger to the multitudes unto
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:58137:171"/>whom the Goſpel is prepared, only for carrying unto them the commanding Will of God, which revealeth unto them their duty and obligation to receive the Goſpel, and to take hold of the Covenant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.17, <hi>Wherefore come out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.</hi> But Chriſt is a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger unto the Elect, not only for carrying unto them Gods Will of command, but alſo his Will of Counſel and Pleaſure, that is, the things which he hath reſolved to act upon their hearts, and to work in them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, <hi>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his counſel, confirmed it by an oath.</hi> Eph. 1.9, <hi>Having made known unto us the myſtery of his will, according to his good pleaſure which he had purpoſed in himſelf.</hi> 4. Whoſe Meſſenger is Chriſt in this Covenant-relation? whether of one of the parties; or of both? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In ſome reſpects he is only the Meſſenger of one of the parties, I mean, as the name doth import a Miſſion, Delegation and Subordination, ſo he is only Gods Meſſenger; becauſe Chriſt Mediator, the Angel of the Covenant, had his commiſſion only from God, and is to give an account of that honourable truſt and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to him only, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth.</hi> Joh. 5.22, <hi>For as the father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, <hi>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the father.</hi> Yea, even in theſe things which he acteth upward (toward his father) as Meſſenger of the Covenant, put caſe his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiating with God for his people, he hath his Miſſion and Delegation from God, for that ſpecial effect, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2, 24, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him. Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> 2. In ſome reſpects he is the Meſſenger of both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as namely, 1. In reſpect of the buſineſs about which he is employed; his Meſſage is about matters of huge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to both the parties of the Covenant; for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers honour, and his peoples happineſs, lay equally in the buſineſs about which he is employed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2, 4, <hi>That he
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58137:172"/>ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou baſt given him. I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> 2. In reſpect of the travels of his ſoul in that buſineſs and Meſſage; he did it cordially, and condeſcendingly did he run the Errants of both the parties; he came his fathers Errant to us, and he went our Errant to his father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.3, <hi>Jeſus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God.</hi> Joh. 14.2, 12, <hi>I go to prepare a place for you, becauſe I go unto my father.</hi> Joh. 16.5, 28, <hi>But now I go my way to him that ſent me, and none of you asketh me, whither goeſt thou? I came forth from the father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the father.</hi> 3. In reſpect of his Ambaſſage and Agency; he was an Ambaſſador and Agent on Gods part; while he was here upon the earth, he was his Meſſenger, who came to declare and to confirm the Covenant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, <hi>To wit, that God was in Chriſt, recanciling the world unto himſelf.</hi> Gal. 4.4, 5, <hi>But when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> And he is now our Agent, he is Meſſenger and Lieger in Heaven on our part, in regard of his conſtant reſidence there for our buſineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24, <hi>For Chriſt is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Act. 3.21, <hi>Whom the heavens muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive until the times of reſtitution of all things.</hi> 4. In reſpect of his correſpondency with both parties: he is correſpondent with God for his people, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8, 25, <hi>For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me. And theſe have known that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> And he is correſpondent with us for God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38, 39, <hi>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me. And this is the fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day.</hi> Luk. 12.32, <hi>Fear not little flock, for it is your fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> He is correſpondent betwixt the confederate parties.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:58137:172"/>5. About what buſmeſs is he Meſſenger? and what is the ſpecial ſubject matter of his employment? <hi>Anſw.</hi> His Name and Covenant-relations do declare the buſineſs; he is <hi>Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Covenant, Legatus faederis, Mal.</hi> 3.1. His Meſſage is as large and broad as all things pertaining to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for the ſins of the people.</hi> So that there is nothing which doth any way relate to the Covenant betwixt God and believers, which falleth not under this Covenant-relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a ſum whereof may be comprehended under theſe three heads. 1. Whatſoever appertaineth to the making of the Covenant, he is Meſſenger betwixt God and his people for that effect; whether it be any thing which belongeth to the courting and wooing of his peoples hearts, by commending his father, and making offers of himſelf, and of his love unto them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2, <hi>In my fathers houſe are many manſions; if it were not ſo, I would have told you.</hi> Joh. 15.1, <hi>I am the true Vine.</hi> Joh. 16.27, <hi>For the father himſelf loveth you.</hi> Joh. 3.16, <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> Joh. 10.14, 29, <hi>I am the good ſhepherd: my father which gave them me, is greater then all.</hi> Wiſdom cryeth, who will have Chriſt? <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.1, <hi>Wiſdom hath builded her houſe, ſhe hath hewn out her ſeven Pillars,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37, 38, <hi>In that laſt day, that great day of the feaſt, Jeſus ſtood, and cried, ſaying, if any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the ſcripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water.</hi> Mat. 11.28, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Hoſ. 2.14, <hi>Therefore behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderneſs, and ſpeak comfortably unto her.</hi> Song. 2.1, <hi>I am the roſe of Sharon, and the lillie of the vallies.</hi> Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be any thing which belongeth to the engaging the hearts of his people, in determining them by his grace, and acting the Covenant upon their hearts; he is Meſſenger alſo for that, to command Souls to engage with him, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and go after him, and to forſake all for him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.37, <hi>And I will cauſe you to paſs under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant.</hi> Ezek. 36.27, <hi>And I will
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:58137:173"/>put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments and do them.</hi> Heb. 8.10, <hi>For this is the covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael; after thoſe days ſaith the Lord: I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.</hi> Pſal. 45.10, <hi>Hearken, O daughter and conſider, and encline thine ear: forget alſo thine own people, and thy fathers houſe.</hi> Gen. 12.1.4, <hi>Now the Lord had ſaid unto Abraham, Get thee out of thy countrey, and from thy kindred, and from thy fathers houſe, unto a Land that I will ſhew thee. So Abraham departed as the Lord had ſpoken unto him.</hi> Mat. 4.19, 20, <hi>And he ſaith unto them, follow me, and I will make you fiſhers of men. And they ſtreight-way left their nets and followed him.</hi> 2. Whatſoever appertaineth to the maintaining and preſerving of the Covenant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy betwixt God and his people, Chriſt is Meſſenger for that and herein he doth; the part of the Meſſenger of the Covenant: 1. By travelling betwixt the parties for keeping up free acceſs betwixt them, and liberty to ſpeak with one another: for it is by him that God hath acceſs to ſpeak to our hearts, and that we have acceſs to him by frequent mutual Meſſages, the Meſſenger being a Courtier and Favourite with both the parties, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18, <hi>For through him we both have acceſs, by one ſpirit, unto the father.</hi> Eph. 3.12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence, by the faith of him.</hi> Heb. 1.1, 2, <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in times paſt unto the fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> 2. By travelling betwixt the parties for correſpondence and entercourſe, to maintain communion and a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt them, to the end that none of the parties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Covenant of kindneſs, become ſtrangers to one another through the want of converſe and correſponding. Chriſt is a Meſſenger betwixt them to maintain the peace and friendſhip, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.16, <hi>A little while and ye ſhall not ſee me: and again a little while, and ye ſhall ſee me: becauſe I go to the father.</hi> Joh. 14.18, 19, <hi>I will not leave you comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world ſeeth me no more; but ye ſee me: becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> 3. He is a Meſſenger to maintain the Covenant betwixt God
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:58137:173"/>and his people, by travelling betwixt the parties with good reports, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24, 25, <hi>And to Jeſus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling, that ſpeaketh bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things then that of Abel. See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh,</hi> &amp;c.

For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.</hi>

Be requeſted to take notice and to liſten what Meſſage the Meſſenger of the Covenant bringeth to you: it is the Meſſage of a Covenant, of a good and ſure bargain, that you would <hi>join your ſelves to the Lord,</hi> and <hi>take hold of his covenant,</hi> Iſa. 56.4, 6.

Now then we are ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye reconciled to God: for he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Luk. 2.10, 14, <hi>And the Angel ſaid unto them, fear not; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people.—Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> Iſa. 60.17, <hi>For braſs I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring ſilver, and for wood braſs, and for ſtones iron: I will alſo make thine officers peace, and thine exactors righteouſneſs.</hi> It's a Meſſage of love, of the Fathers love, and of the Sons, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1, <hi>Behold, what manner of love the father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, becauſe it knew him not.</hi> Joh. 15.13,

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Chriſt a Servant in the Covenant.</head>
               <p>THE fifth relation which Chriſt ſuſtaineth in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is, He is a Servant in the buſineſs of the Covenant. Many Scriptures point at Chriſt under this Covenant-relation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. and 49.3, 5, 6. and 52.13, and 53.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.23, 24. and 37.24, 25. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.27. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.45. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. For the better underſtanding whereof, let us a little enquire in theſe ſix Particulars: 1. In what reſpects this name is given to Chriſt. 2. How he came under this Covenant-relation. 3. Whoſe Servant he is. 4. What kind of Service this is, which lyeth upon Chriſt by this Covenant-relation. 5. What doth pertain to his office, as Servant in the Covenant; and what was the Service he did in the buſineſs of the Covenant. 6. Some
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:58137:180"/>things in his Service, which commend his acting in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-relation.</p>
               <p>And, 1. This Name, which is a name not only of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and ſubjection (as is the name Meſſenger), but of the loweſt and moſt abject condition of ſubordination. I ſay, 1. This name is given to Chriſt, not in regard of his nature, but in regard of his office as Mediator, as he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him a Service; this name is not a name of nature, for in regard of his Divine nature he hath another ſtyle, <hi>My Son</hi> is his name, not <hi>my Servant,</hi> Mat. 3.17, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> And in regard of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, though the man Chriſt is by nature Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, yet he is not by nature a common Servant to both the parties in the Covenant, nor a Servant of the Covenant, but a Free-man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.26, <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto him, then are the children free.</hi> Therefore I ſay, it is not the name of the natural only begotten Son of God, nor the name of the man Chriſt (as it importeth any thing peculiar, and not common to the reſt of the creatures); but it is the name of Chriſt Mediator, <hi>God-man,</hi> Heb. 12.24. 2. This name is given to Chriſt mainly and eminently, in regard of the ſtate and condition of his humiliation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8, <hi>But made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of men: and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs.</hi> For though now, when God hath highly exalted him, he be ſtill a Prieſt upon a Throne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1, and conſequently promoting the ſame Truſt and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice about which he was ſent to the earth; yet his way of carrying on that Service is ſo Princely, as he carryeth condeſcendingly to men, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10, <hi>Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry name: that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earrh, and things under the earth.</hi> If we ſhould yet name him by this Covenant-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we behoved to look upon him as a kinged and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Servant, who for performing that notable Service that was committed unto him, hath been exalted to a Glorious Throne; and yet for all his preferment, is as humble, and affable, and eaſie to be ſpoke with, as when he was upon
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:58137:180"/>the earth; for he beareth the ſame heart toward his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, 16, <hi>For we have not an High-prieſt, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</hi> 3. The name of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the buſineſs of the Covenant, is given to Chriſt, in regard of his truſt; becauſe the greateſt truſt that ever was put upon man, was put upon him by the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: he was entruſted with a rare piece of Service; the ſaving of ſinners, the carrying through the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, the weight of the loſt World being laid upon his ſhoulders, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6, <hi>And he ſaid, it is a light thing that thou ſhouldſt be my ſervant, to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſerved of Iſrael: I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation unto the end of the earth.</hi> Joh. 17.2, <hi>As thou haſt given him pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> Joh. 5.22, <hi>For as the father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.</hi> 4. This name is given to Chriſt, in regard of his work; for it is a name of work as well as of truſt, becauſe he ſerved a great Service in the buſineſs of the Covenant. I have elſewhere ſhewed, that the whole buſineſs of Redemption was his work: therefore you find he ſpeaks often of his work, and labour, and ſpending his ſtrength, and of the travel of his Soul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4, <hi>Then I ſaid, I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought, and in vain.</hi> Iſa. 53.10, 11, <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief: when thou ſhalt make his Soul an offering for ſin, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his Soul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> Joh. 4.34, <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi> Joh. 17.4, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth: I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> Joh. 8.29, <hi>And he that ſent me is with me: the father hath not left me alone; for I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi> 5. This name is given to Chriſt, in regard of his wages and reward, which redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him by this great Service which he performed unto
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:58137:181"/>God, by ſaving the elect world, which yet muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of no ſervile reward, for his love could not be hired: but we read of a reward promiſed and compacted unto him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, 12, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his Soul, and ſhall be ſatisfied. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong: becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death: and he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors, and he bare the ſin of many, and made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Pſal. 2.8, <hi>Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> A reward expected and eyed by him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4, 5, <hi>Yet ſurely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God. Though Iſreal be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength.</hi> A reward craved by him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, 5, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth: I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do: And now; O father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi> A reward pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him as the fruit of his labours, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9, <hi>And being found in faſhon as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even unto the death of the croſs. Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name, Heb.</hi> 12.2. 6. The name of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is given to him, in regard of the ſpirit of fear unto which he did ſubject himſelf for a ſeaſon, while he was here in our nature, in the ſhape of a Servant: I ſay, though there were always in the heart of Chriſt a deſign of love, which made him run and ſerve in the buſineſs of the Covenant; yet there was ſomething of the ſpirit of a Servant in the man Chriſt, made under the law; and having taken upon him our condition, as well as our nature (which yet muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be ſuch as did well ſtand with the heart of a Son, yea, with the heighth of that tranſcendent love, which was the love of God). And in regard of this he is ſaid to be <hi>made under the law,</hi> Gal. 4.4. When he put his name in our bond, he took on our ſevile condition, and ſubjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to threatnings and terrors of the law: and hence it is that he is ſaid to <hi>fear,</hi> Heb. 5.7. and to be <hi>troubled in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Joh. 12.27. and 13.21.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:58137:181"/>2. But what engaged him, and brought Chriſt under this Covenant-relation, to become a Servant? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sure it was by no neceſſity of nature that Chriſt was engaged in this Service; for he was not engaged, becauſe he could not chuſe but he muſt be a Servant: But rather I judg theſe four things did engage him: 1. The Lords choice and call; the Lord did freely and of meer Grace make choice of Chriſt, and ſend him in this Service, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 6, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold: mine elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth.—I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſs, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee.</hi> Iſa. 61.1, <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tydings unto the meek: he hath ſent me to bind the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound.</hi> Iſa. 49.7, 9, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the redeemer of Iſrael, and his holy one, to him whom man deſpiſeth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a ſervant of rulers: kings ſhall ſee and ariſe, princes alſo ſhall worſhip, becauſe of the Lord, that is faithful, and the holy one of Iſrael, and he ſhall chuſe thee, that thou mayeſt ſay to the priſoners, go forth; to them that are in darkneſs, ſhew your ſelves.</hi> 2. His own love engaged him: there was always in the heart of Chriſt, a deſign and aim of love to the elect world, and this engaged him in the Service of a Covenant, by which he might enjoy them, and they him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13, 1, 3, 4, <hi>Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the feaſt of the paſſeover, when Jeſus knew that his hour was come, that he ſhould depart out of this world unto the father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.—And that he was come from God, and went to God.—And he took a towel, and girded himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. 3. His own free conſent, who was as willing to undertake this ſervice, as the Lord was to ſend him: this engaged him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18, <hi>Therefore doth my father love me, becauſe I lay down my life that I might take it again, No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again, this commandment have I received of my father.</hi> Heb. 10, 7, <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.</hi> His free conſent and agreement, to be a Servant by voluntary condeſcenſion, this engaged him, and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:58137:182"/>made him a Servant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and was made in the likeneſs of men.</hi> 4. His compact and Covenant engaged him: for he not only conſented to ſerve in this buſineſs of the Covenant, but he graciouſly condeſcended to be hired to perform ſuch a Service, and undertook for it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12, <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief: when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: by his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many: for he ſhall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong: becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death: and he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors, and he bare the ſin of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Theſe, and nothing but theſe did conclude and determine Chriſt under this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-relation, to ſerve this great Service of ſaving the loſt world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whoſe Servant was Chriſt in the buſineſs of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? whether of one of the parties, or of both? was he his fathers Servant only? or ours alſo? <hi>Anſw.</hi> He was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Servant to both parties, God's Servant, and our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: I ſhall clear it by the following particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He was God's Servant, for ſo his father frequently ſtyles him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, <hi>Behold my ſervant. Iſa.</hi> 53.11, <hi>My righteous ſervant. Zech.</hi> 3.8, <hi>My ſervant the branch.</hi> So he acknowledged himſelf to be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> Heb. 10.9, <hi>Then ſaid he, Lo, I come to do thy will</hi> (O God). <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38, <hi>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He was our Servant alſo; for ſo he confeſſeth himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28, <hi>Even as the ſon of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſom for many,</hi> Luk. 22.27. And ſo he behaved himſelf, and in his carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age while he was on earth, he gave proof of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.4, 5, 14, 15, <hi>He riſeth from ſupper, and laid aſide his garments, and took a towel, and girded himſelf. After that, he poureth
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:58137:182"/>water into a baſon, and began to waſh the diſciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel, wherewith he was girded.—And ſaid, if I then your lord and maſter have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers feet. For I have given you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He was Servant to both parties, but with this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable difference, which is to be underſtood and cautioned: 1. Chriſt was Servant to God, in the Covenant and work of Redemption, by choice and election, not ſo to us: God made choice of him for this work, but we did not make choice of him; he made choice of us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold: mine elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth.</hi> Joh. 15.16, <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, and ordained you, that ye ſhould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit ſhould remain.</hi> 2. He was God's Servant, not by condeſcenſion only, but by Covenant and compact with God; he is our Servant by condeſcenſion, but by no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with us. In all Covenant-relations betwixt him and us, he is our Lord and Maſter, he is our Head and Husband, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.11, <hi>For he is the Lord, and worſhip thou him.</hi> Pſal. 110.1, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot-ſtool.</hi> And what further ſtooping is upon his part, is voluntary humbling of himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.13, 14, <hi>Ye call me maſter and Lord, and ye ſay well: for ſo I am. If I then your Lord and maſter have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one anothers feet.</hi> Phil. 2.7, <hi>But made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men.</hi> 3. He is God's Servant, not for love only to the work wherein he Serveth; but for wages, as I have already ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but he is our Servant for no wages nor reward which he could expect from us, but purely for love, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1, <hi>Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</hi> Joh. 15.13, <hi>Greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> 4. He is God's Servant, as a Son ſerveth his father, yea as a Servant ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Maſter, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6, <hi>A ſon honoureth his father, and a ſervant his maſter.</hi> Phil. 2.7, <hi>And took upon him the form of a ſervant.</hi> Joh. 6.38, <hi>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> But he is
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:58137:183"/>our Servant, as a friend ſerveth his friend, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.14, <hi>Ye are my friends if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> And as a man Serveth one whom he loveth and wooeth, which he doth neither for fear nor reward, but being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted and determined to do ſo, from a principle of love, and a deſign of love within himſelf: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.29, <hi>He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which ſtandeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly becauſe of the bridegrooms voice.</hi> Song 5.2, <hi>It is the voice of my beloved that knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſaying, open to me, my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. What kind of Service is it which belongeth to Chriſt by this Covenant-relation? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It was the <hi>greateſt</hi> piece of Service and truſt that ever was put upon man: no leſs then the whole work of our Redemption and Salvation, the weight of the loſt World, and of all the elect, was upon his ſhoulders in this Service, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.24, <hi>And they ſhall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers houſe, the off-ſpring and the iſſue, all veſſels of ſmall quantity; from the veſſels of cups, even to all the veſſels of flaggons.</hi> Joh. 17.2, 3, 4, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life to as many as thou haſt given him. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent. I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> 2. It was the <hi>hardeſt</hi> piece of Service that ever was laid upon any perſon. O what a hard Service was it to deſtroy the works of the Devil, to bind the ſtrong man, and to ſpoil his houſe, to fall into his quarters, and to bring off the priſoners; yea, to go into the priſon, and to ſet open the dores, and let the priſoners go free; to enter his perſon in priſon for them; to pay the debt of ſo many broken men; to bear their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and the chaſtiſement of their peace; to endure the ſtroak of the wakened up ſword of Divine Juſtice in our ſtead! <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. It was the hardſhip of this Service that made him heavy and grieved, that made him pray, and cry, and weep, and ſweat blood, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 26.22, 42, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.24. The Service of no labouring man, of no ſlave, that ſerveth for hire, as a ſtranger in another country, is
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:58137:183"/>to be compared with the hardſhip of his Service. 3. This Service was an <hi>honourable</hi> place and Service; he ſerved as a King, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1, <hi>Now of the things which we have ſpoken, this is the ſum; we have ſuch an High-prieſt, who is ſet on the right hand of the throne of the Majeſty in the heavens.</hi> Joh. 5.22, 23, <hi>For as the father judgeth no man: but hath committed all judgment unto the Son, that all men ſhould ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Son, even as they honour the father. He that honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, not the Son, honoureth not the father which hath ſent him.</hi> Iſa. 22.23, 24, <hi>And he ſhall be for a glorious throne to his fathers houſe. And they ſhall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers houſe, the off-ſpring and the iſſue.</hi> Yea, It's a greater place than to be a King; for by it the man Chriſt is exalted far above all principality, and conſtituted Judg and Ruler of the Nations, Prince of the Kings of the Earth, head of the Church, and King of Saints. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. and 17.14. 4. It was the moſt <hi>kindly</hi> Service that ever was done by man; for it was the Service of love, the deſign of love that was in his heart, made him <hi>with good will</hi> to ſerve: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3, <hi>The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, ſaying, yea, I have loved thee with an everlaſting love: therefore with loving-kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> He Served not only as a hired man and a ſtranger in a far Country, and as a King and great Lord Ambaſſador, whoſe Service was a Rule and Government; but he ſerved alſo as a lover, becauſe of the deſign of love, and of eternal enjoyment of his choſen people, which was in his heart, he wearied not to ſerve his father, who had promiſed to give him the people whom he loved with an everlaſting love; and he wearied not to ſerve his people, that he might court and woo them to himſelf; he did ſerve for the ſatisfaction that he promiſed to himſelf, in the enjoyment of the people, upon whom he had ſet his heart; and as low a price as poor ſinners are, yet he count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them worthy to be compaſſed with ſo high a deſign; he reckoned them a wager and recompence for all his Service, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> Heb. 12.2, <hi>Who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> His Service is not unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:58137:184"/>reſembled by <hi>Jacobs,</hi> who Served for a Wife whom he loved, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.15, 21, 27, <hi>And Laban ſaid unto Jacob, Becauſe thou art my brother ſhouldſt thou therefore ſerve me for nought? tell me what ſhall thy wages be.—And Jacob ſaid unto Laban, Give me my wife, (for my days are fulfilled)—Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this alſo for the ſervice which thou ſhalt ſerve with me, yet ſeven other years.</hi>

What was the Service which Chriſt did in the buſineſs of the Covenant? though this cannot be ſufficiently anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, who have not yet come to know and underſtand half of that which he hath done for his people, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, <hi>But as it is written, Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> 1 Joh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is in general called by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>the work which his father gave him to do,</hi> Joh. 17.4. By which we underſtand, all that Chriſt had in commiſſion to do in our nature, from the time of his receiving a commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be the Mediator of the Covenant, unto the time of his delivering up the Kingdom to his father; more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, this Service which Chriſt did in the buſineſs of the Covenant, it's called <hi>the reſtitution of all things,</hi> Act. 3.21. When Chriſt ſhall bring all things out of that diſordered and ruined condition whereunto they were brought by the fall of man, and ſhall reſtore them to the Primitive integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; when he ſhall reſtore fore-faulted man into his firſt eſtate of innocency and happineſs, by taking of the fore-ſaulture, and bringing him out of his excommunicated exiled conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into the preſence and fellowſhip of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12, 13, <hi>That at that time ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the commonwealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenant of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world. But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.</hi> And when <hi>the creatures
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:58137:184"/>ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.21. This Service is called, the <hi>bearing the tranſgreſſions of many, the making his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> Iſa. 53.10, 12. It was the putting his Soul in our Souls ſtead; that the law might overtake him, that juſtice might ſmite him for us, and might take ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him, for the broken Covenant; it was the offering up of himſelf in a Sacrifice; the putting of his Soul in the flame of hot burning wrath for us, that the furbuſhed and wakened-up ſword of Divine Juſtice might be bathed in his blood, until it was full of blood, and ſatisfied, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſpirit, offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God.</hi> Zech. 13.7, <hi>Awake, O ſword, againſt my ſhepherd, and againſt the man that is my fellow, ſaith the Lord of hoſts: ſmite the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi> &amp;c.

By which we underſtand, all the travel of his Soul, in the propounding, treating, and concluding of a peace 'twixt God and ſinners: for all that Service was laid upon him, and was performed by him: for he maketh the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of peace, he carryeth on the treaty, until his own hand lead our hand to ſign the articles of peace propounded in the Goſpel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17, <hi>And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19, 20, <hi>To wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them: and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</hi> 2 Cor. 9.13, <hi>Whiles by the experiment of this miniſtration, they glorifie God for your profeſſed ſubjection unto the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> This Service is called the <hi>ſaving of the loſt world,</hi> Luk. 19.10. And the <hi>bringing many Sons to glory,</hi> Heb. 2.10. That was a great Service indeed, to have the weight of the loſt world upon his ſhouldiers; to have the keeping and leading, yea, the bearing in his arms of all that numberleſs number of the ranſomed and redeemed ones, whom God had appointed unto Glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12, <hi>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: thoſe that thou gaveſt me, I have kept, and none of them is loſt.</hi> Iſa. 40.11, <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a ſhepherd: he ſhall gather the lambs with his arm,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:58137:185"/>and carry them in his boſome, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> In a word, the Service which Chriſt did in the buſineſs of the Covenant, was the the tranſacting of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; he did all that buſineſs from beginning to end; and without him was nothing done of all things pertaining to God, and a new Covenant betwixt him and us: whereof ſee more particularly what we have ſpoken of the Mediator of the Covenant, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</p>

Think with your ſelves and conſider the love that made him come under this Covenant-relation; that made him a common Servant to both the parties: for though he had wages and a reward propounded to him; yet it was love that acted Chriſt in performing this great piece of Service. His Service of love is much commended, 1. From the infinite condeſcenſion that was in it: O what condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was it for <hi>a Son</hi> to become a Servant! <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8, <hi>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he ſuffered:</hi> for <hi>the Son,</hi> the only begotten Son and Heir, to become a Servant! <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.37, 38, <hi>But laſt of all, he ſent unto them his Son, ſaying, they will reverence my Son. But when the husbandmen ſaw the Son, they ſaid among themſelves, this is the heir, come, let us kill him, and let us ſeize on his inheritance.</hi> For <hi>the Son of God</hi> to become a Servant to the ſons of men! <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himſelf of no reputation: And took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men.</hi> 2. From the voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his coming under this Covenant-relation; when he was not a Servant by any neceſſity of nature, that he made himſelf one; that when nothing elſe was to do it, his grace, his love determined him to go and ſerve his enemies, and <hi>make himſelf of no reputation,</hi> Phil. 2.7. Rom. 5.8, <hi>But God commended his love toward us, in that while we were yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> Heb. 10.9, <hi>Then ſaid he, Lo, I come to do thy will (O God).</hi> O what ſtrange love was that, which made Chriſt ſo willingly leave the Throne, and come down to the foot-ſtool, and ſtand and ſerve! <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28, <hi>Even as the Son of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſome for many.</hi> Joh. 13.4, 5, <hi>He riſeth from ſupper, and laid aſide his garments, and took a
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:58137:185"/>towel, and girded himſelf. After that, he poureth water into a baſon, and began to waſh the diſciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</hi> Gal. 2.20, <hi>And the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> 3. His Service of love is commended, from the lowneſs of the wager and price which he is to have for his Service and love. Was man a crown and wager for Chriſt to work and to run for, that he might win it? how great a diſproportion is there betwixt the Service and the Wages? Can poor polluted nothings, ſuch as we are, be a price for ſuch Love, for ſuch Service, for ſuch tranſcendent infinite Love? and yet ſuch was the wager for which he ſerved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1, <hi>Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</hi> Joh. 17.19, <hi>And for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo might be ſanctified through the truth.</hi> 4. His Service is commended from the largeneſs of his deſign of Love, through which he did drive the ſerving of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; that God, the Son of God, did drive this piece of Service through ſo deep, and broad, and long a deſign of tranſcendent love, from everlaſting to everlaſting; through ſo many decrees, which at laſt could produce nothing in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, but this price, To have his poor people engaged to him by a Covenant; whereas we might think a lower deſign might compaſs ſinners, and a leſs price might buy poor man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3, <hi>The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, ſaying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlaſting love: therefore with loving-kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1, <hi>Behold what manner of love the father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, becauſe it knew him not.</hi> Eph. 3.18, 19,—<hi>may be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend with all ſaints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height: and to know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledg, that ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> 5. His Service is commended for his performing of it, and doing his work ſo long before he was to reap that low price of all the travel of his Soul, to wit, the enjoyment of his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied:</hi> He ſerved long ago for that wager which is not not yet payed to him; and he knew when he ſerved that
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:58137:186"/>Service, that he ſhould lie ſo long out of a great part of his ſatisfaction, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20, <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word.</hi>

Wo to them that will not ſerve him, who refuſe a conſent of their Service to him, who made himſelf a Servant for our ſake, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.14, <hi>But his citizens hated him, and ſent a meſſage after him, ſaying, We will not have this man to reign over us.</hi> Pſal. 2.3, <hi>Let us break their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us.</hi> We love to be Lords over our own liberty and wills, and to break his bands. 2. Wo to them that think ſhame to ſerve him: there is a generation that think it is below them to ſerve Chriſt; they judg his Service is not honourable, though he was not aſhamed to ſerve us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.27, <hi>For whether is greater, he that ſitteth at meat, or he that ſerveth? is not he that ſitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that ſerveth.</hi> Heb. 2.11, <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified are all of one; for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them brethren:</hi> And though it be no ſhame, but honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſerve him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.16, <hi>O Lord, truly I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant, and the Son of thine hand-maid: thou haſt looſed my bonds.</hi> Pſal. 84.10, <hi>For a day in thy courts is better then a thouſand: I had rather be a dore-keeper in the houſe of my God, then to dwell in the-tents of wickedneſs.</hi> Ifa. 58.13, <hi>And call the ſabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and ſhalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words.</hi> 3.

Conſider what advantages we have by his Service: 1. His condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was the cauſe of our exaltation: if he had not ſerved, we had not reigned: if he had not come down to the footſtool, we ſhould never have come up to the Throne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8, 9, <hi>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he ſuffered: and being made perfect, he became the Author of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſalvation unto all them that obey him.</hi> Rom. 8.17, <hi>And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt: if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together.</hi> 2. It was the hardſhip of his Service which makes ours ſo eaſie; he left us little to do: when he was made under the law, he did bear away the bondage of our Service and Duties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4, <hi>Wherefore my brethren, ye alſo are become dead to the law by the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another, even to him who is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God:</hi> He did hear the hard and inſupportable yoke, and left us nothing to do,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:58137:187"/>but to ſerve for love; he brake the force and power of the adverſary, and left us only a broken party and routed forces to deal with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, <hi>O death, where is thy-ſting? O grave, where is thy victory?</hi> Yea, he hath not left us alone to deal with theſe. 3. By his Service we have our liberty; and can be no more Servants, but Friends and Children of the houſe. See <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6, 7, <hi>But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of Sons. And becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba, father: wherefore thou art no more a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant but a Son: and if a Son, then an heir of God through Chriſt.</hi> Joh. 8.36, <hi>If the Son therefore ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed.</hi> Joh. 15.15, <hi>Henceforth I call you not ſervants, for the ſervant knoweth not what his Lord doth; but I have called you friends: for all thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By his Service we have wages and a reward for our Service, even for our poor worthleſs endeavours after duty, about which there are ſo many queſtionings in the hearts of believers, whether they ſhall be accepted, and but few thoughts of a recompence. I ſay, our Service could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been rewarded but for his Service: this brought with it not acceptation only, but a reward to ours, upon his account, being done in his name, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10, <hi>So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye, when ye ſhall have done all theſe things which are commanded you, ſay, We are unprofitable ſervants; we have done that which was but our duty to do.</hi> Heb. 11.6, <hi>And that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Iſa. 45.19, <hi>I ſaid not unto the ſeed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.</hi> Iſa. 56.6, 7, <hi>Alſo the ſons of the ſtranger that join themſelves to the Lord, to ſerve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be

               <p>But that we may a little more particularly conſider the nature of this relation and Suretiſhip of Chriſt: 1.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:58137:191"/>party to deal with; man being a broken unbelieving creature, who could neither truſt God, nor was to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18, <hi>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the heirs of promiſe, the immutability of his counſel, confirmed it by an outh, that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi> Pſal. 89.19, <hi>Then thou ſpakeſt in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thy holy one, and ſaidſt, I have laid help upon one that is mighty: I have exalted one choſen out of the people.</hi> And ſo the Surety of the Covenant is that perſon upon whoſe account, truſt and confidence is betwixt the parties Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, and in whom it ſtandeth faſt. 2. If we conſider the Suretiſhip, 1. It imports an obligement for another, and is to be reckoned among Contracts and Covenants; and therefore the Lawyers ſay,<note place="margin">Fuſtinian. ib.

                  <hi>fide juſſor non fit niſi per ſtipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem;</hi> and they reckon it among contracts and ſtipulations. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.26, <hi>Be not thou one of them that ſtrike hands, or of them that are ſureties for debts.</hi> And indeed Chriſts Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is relative to a Covenant betwixt him and the Creditor; whereby he came under this relation, whereof we have ſpoken elſewhere on this ſubject, <hi>Chap.</hi> And ſhall hint ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further ere we paſs it over. 2. It imports a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obligation, as I have ſhewed in expounding the word: The law cannot force and compel any man to be Surety for another, though it may conſtrain him for his own Debt. Chriſts Suretiſhip was a moſt free voluntary act on his part: for he was not under any obligation of law, nor under any neceſſity of nature, to put his name in our bond, or to ſatisfie for our Debt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18, <hi>No man taketh it (my life) from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again: this commandment have I received of my father.</hi> Heb. 10.5, 7, <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me: then ſaid I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.</hi> Phil. 2.7, <hi>But made himſelf of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men.</hi> 3.

He put his name in our bond, that the law might reach him for our Debt. 4. It imports a communion betwixt the Debtor and the Cautioner, whereby as the Debt of the principal Debtor becometh the Debt of the Surety, and affecteth him; ſo alſo the ſatisfaction and payment of the Surety, and his diſcharge and relief, becometh the ſatisfaction, diſcharge and relief of the principal Debtor.

It imports a commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſurrogation, or ſubſtituting of one in the room of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo Chriſt was ſubſtitute in our ſtead and room, as <hi>Judah</hi> was in <hi>Benjamines,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, <hi>Becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> Rom. 4. laſt, <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed again for our juſtification,</hi> Rom. 5.8, <hi>But God commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his love toward us, in that, while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> Gen. 44.33, <hi>Now therefore I pray thee, Let thy ſervant abide in ſtead of the lad, a bond-man to my Lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren.</hi> 6.

               <p>Suretiſhip is diſtinguiſhed according to the manner of aſſurance granted by the Surety, or according to the way of his making faith for his undertaking. He that interpoſeth and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh for another, is properly a Surety, <hi>quocunque modo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſerit,</hi> which way ſoever he doth interpoſe for another, whether it be by ſtipulation; explicite, by promiſe or by bond; or if it be by a perſon, acting himſelf in the books of any court for another perſon; or if it be by giving any pledg, pawn, or hoſtage for the thing undertaken: Our Lord Jeſus had ſomething of all theſe ways in his Suretiſhip for his people. He acted himſelf in the court of Heaven, and book of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.</hi> He did expreſly give his promiſe and bond for his people unto all effects (whereof afterward), <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, 31, <hi>And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments, and do them.—Then ſhall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your iniquities, and for your abominations.</hi> Which is aſcribed to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. He did give himſelf, his own bleſſed perſon, to the priſon and to juſtice, as a pledg and hoſtage to God, for the fulfilling of this Covenant; a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and worthy pledg to lie Surety for the Debt of all his broken people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.8, 12, <hi>He was taken from priſon, and from judgment: and who ſhall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living, for the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my people was he ſtricken. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong: becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death.</hi> Gen. 44.33, <hi>Now therefore I pray thee, let thy ſervant abide in ſtead of the lad, a bond-man to my Lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren.</hi> 1 Chron. 21.17, <hi>Let thine hand, I pray thee, O Lord my God, be on me, and on my fathers houſe: but not on thy people, that they ſhould be plagued.</hi> He verily act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that which <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſaid in theſe Scriptures:

Suretiſhip is diſtinguiſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſubject-matter, and things undertaken. A Surety is either, 1. A Surety for Debt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.26, <hi>Be not thou one of them that ſtrike hands, or of them that are ſureties for Debts.</hi> Or, 2.

               <p>The third thing to be conſidered, is,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Ruth.</hi> treatiſe of the Covenant. <hi>p.</hi> 2. c. 7.</note> how Chriſt came under this Covenant-relation, to be Surety of the better Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To this the Apoſtle gives an anſwer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>He was made the Surety of a better Teſtament, or Covenant.</hi> If Jeſus was made the Surety, then, 1. He was not Surety by nature, nor by any natural neceſſity: Then, 2. He was not Surety by any neceſſity, or conſtraint of Law: he was not ſo made Surety, becauſe there was no Law that could exact upon him, anteceding his bond of Suretiſhip; neither could there be any neceſſity upon him, there being no conjunction betwixt him and us (antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his act of Suretiſhip), by any relations, whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, legal, foederal, or myſtical, until this voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and Covenant-relation of Suretiſhip was brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, upon which all his offices, and all other relations 'twixt Chriſt and his people are founded. I take therefore the making of him Surety, ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late mainly to that eternal free tranſaction and Covenant of Suretiſhip that was betwixt God and Chriſt, whereby he came under a judicial and Law act to ſatisfie for the ſins of his people.</p>
               <p>And this imports, 1. Something on Gods part, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.21, He was made Surety <hi>by him, that ſaid unto him, The Lord ſware, and will not repent,</hi> &amp;c. God made him the Surety of the better Teſtament. I ſay on Gods part, the making of him Surety, imports three things: 1. His eternal decree, whereby he was deſigned, ordained, and choſen in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God for this Suretiſhip: he <hi>was made</hi> the Surety, that is, deſigned and ordained to this by an everlaſting decree, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6, 10, <hi>And no man taketh this honour unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an High-prieſt; but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. As he ſaith alſo in another place, Thou art a prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedec.—Called of God an High-prieſt, after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> Pſal. 2.7, <hi>I will declare the decree, the Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> Iſa. 42.1, <hi>Behold, my ſervant whom I
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:58137:198"/>uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth.</hi> 2. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, furniſhing, and fitting of Chriſt for this buſineſs: he <hi>was made</hi> the Surety, <hi>i. e.</hi> He was anointed and qualified for that work: ſo the father ſaith of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 4, 6, <hi>I have put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.—He ſhall not fail, nor be diſcouraged, till he have ſet judgment in the earth, and the Iſles ſhall wait for his law.—I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſs, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.</hi> And ſo Jeſus ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, <hi>A body haſt thou prepared or fitted me:</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, alſo the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, That he was not only <hi>made of a woman,</hi> but <hi>made under the law,</hi> i. e. ordained and fitted for taking on our condition in Law, or our Law-place and room, as well as our nature. 3. The inveſting of him in this relation; he <hi>was ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. This imports ſome things upon Chriſts part: He <hi>was made Surety;</hi> God made him Surety, his father made him, and he made himſelf the Surety: he was willingly made Surety by his own free conſent and Covenant: the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeak frequently of his conſent, and of the making of himſelf, whatſoever his father made him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8, <hi>He made himſelf of no reputation.</hi> &amp;c. and he <hi>humbled himſelf.</hi> Joh. 10.18, <hi>No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down my ſelf.</hi> I ſay, on Chriſts part this doth import, 1. His eternal condeſeending to empty himſelf, and to take on him our nature, and our room, and place, under the Law; he <hi>was made Surety,</hi> he condeſcended, and agreed to take upon him both our nature and our condition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 16, <hi>Foraſmuch then as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death. that is the devil.—For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels; but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> Phil. 2.6, 7,

                  <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men.</hi> 2. His engaging and plighting his faith and truth to perform whatſoever he did condeſceud and agree unto by his act of Suretiſhip, ſo that whatſoever the law could exact of us, he plighted his faith to fulfil that: he <hi>was made Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> i.e. He did promiſe and ſtrike hands to ſatisfie all that the Law could demand of his people (for ſo the word <hi>Surety</hi> ſignifieth, as I have already ſhewed you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.26.) to make ſatisfaction for the ſins done againſt or under the firſt Covenant and Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, <hi>And for this cauſe he is the mediator of the new Teſtament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi> Rom. 3.25, <hi>Whom God had ſet forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God.</hi> Heb. 10.5, 7, <hi>Wherefore when he cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, he ſaith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me: then ſaid I, Lo I come (in the volume of the book, it written of me) to do thy will, O God.</hi> 3. His performance of all theſe things unto which he did agree, and for which he plighted his faith, by his act of Suretiſhip: he <hi>was made</hi> the Surety, <hi>i. e.</hi> He payed the debt, he ſatisfied the Law, he ſtood in the place of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken men, till Juſtice ſaid, It is enough: and till he himſelf ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> Iſa. 53, throughout. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21, <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Gal. 3.13, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> Thus did Jeſus the Surety of the better Teſtament, 1.

               <p>From this voluntary relation of Chriſts Suretiſhip for his
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:58137:199"/>people ariſeth a fourfold relation, which is founded on this, which relations betwixt Chriſt and his people import a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of conjunction and union with them, and do contribute to the clearing the juſtice of God, in ſmiting Chriſt for our ſin, and in our place and room. 1. From Chriſts Suretiſhip ariſeth a <hi>natural</hi> relation betwixt him and us, that he is our kinſman, and our brother, of the ſame nature, of the ſame fleſh and blood with us: this reſulteth from his Suretiſhip, whereby he condeſcended and agreed to take our nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: for otherwiſe he and we had never been of the ſame lump, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11, 14, 16, <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one: for which cauſe he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to call them brethren.—Foraſmuch then as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame.—For verily he took not on him the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> 2. From his Suretiſhip flows a <hi>Legal</hi> relation betwixt Chriſt and us, that he and we are one party in the Law: that his ſatisfaction and payment is ours, and that our debt is his: that what he did and ſuffered, we did it Legally in him: this proceeds from his Suretiſhip, becauſe when he was made Surety of the Covenant, he put himſelf in the bond and writ of the Law, and put in our names in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Brinſt.</hi> of the Mediator, <hi>pag.</hi> 123, &amp;c.</note> by a free conſent and agreement betwixt God and Chriſt in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereby God willingly made him the Surety, and he willingly made himſelf the Surety; this I ſay, doth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly commend this grace of God in the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt the Surety of the Covenant, eſpecially in theſe things. 1. It was grace and favour in God, that he was pleaſed to diſpence ſo far with his own Law, as to admit of ſatisfaction by a Surety, and not to ſtand upon the rigour thereof, which requires that the ſame ſoul that ſinned might ſuffer and die, and no other for him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17, <hi>But of the tree of the knowledg of good and evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> Gal. 3.10, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.</hi> It is grace, that the ſame ſoul that ſinned dieth not, but another: and yet more grace, that every ſoul that ſinneth, dieth not, but one for many, one for all the Elect world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28, <hi>And to give his life a ranſome for many.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.15, <hi>And that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi> 2. This was grace in God, that he did not only admit this way of ſatisfaction, but himſelf did find it out. The finding out of a way of ſatisfaction to juſtice, without the eternal puniſhment of the ſinner, this was Gods act, and this was one act of ſpecial grace: for it was not only above the reach of men and Angels, but alſo before their being, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 8, <hi>But we ſpeak the wiſdom of God in a myſtery, even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the world, unto our glory: Which none of the princes of this world knew.</hi> Prov. 8.23, 30, <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or ever the earth was. Then I was by him, as one
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:58137:201"/>brought up with him: and I was daily his delight: rejoycing always before him.</hi> 3. This was pure grace in God, that he did deſign, provide, and foreſee a Surety and ſactisfaction for us, before we became broken men, and needed one; that he deſigned a Phyſician before we were ſick, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began.</hi> 4. This was grace, even ſingular grace in God, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did admit of this way of ſatisfaction for the ſin of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, nor did he find it out for them, but unto men only did he indulge this diſpenſation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 16, <hi>Foraſmuch then as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil.—For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels: but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.4, <hi>For if God ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkneſs, to be reſerved unto judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Jude verſ. 6, <hi>And the Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation, he hath reſerved in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great day.</hi> There was no relaxation of the rigour of the law to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them; but a ſtrict execution of juſtice upon them. 5. It was unſpeakable grace in God, that having admitted of ſuch a way of ſatisfaction, he ſhould put his own Son upon the work, and make him the Surety, who ſhould make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction unto the juſtice of God, by giving his life a ranſome for us: ſuch an act of grace as this hath not been heard of: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Rom. 5.8, <hi>But God commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.2, <hi>And he is the propitiation for our ſins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.10, <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> 6. It is grace in God, that when he hath found out this way of ſatisfaction, and is content to admit of it, and hath put his Son upon the work, that he ſhould be at the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:58137:201"/>pains to reveal to us Chriſts Surety righteouſneſs, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it unto us, without which the ſatisfaction of the Surety could not avail us: and what elſe can it be but grace in God, that maketh the ſatisfaction of Chriſt effectual to one, and not to another, who hath alſo heard of this way of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying-juſtice? <hi>Job</hi> 33.23, 24, <hi>If there be a meſſenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thouſand, to ſhew unto man his uprightneſs. Then he is gracious unto him, and ſaith, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ranſom.</hi> Joh. 6.44, <hi>No man can come to me, except the father which hath ſent me, draw him: and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Eph. 2.8, <hi>For by grace are ye ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> And upon this account it is, that juſtification and remiſſion of ſins are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led free, notwithſtanding the ſatisfaction of Chriſt; that the wonderful riches of Gods free grace might ſhine in the Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25, <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> Rom. 3.24, <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. For whom is Chriſt engaged as Surety of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? (I ſpeak now of his Suretiſhip, only as it relateth to his act of cautionry for his people; remitting the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in a larger extent, unto the next thing to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon this Subject) Before I anſwer this Queſtion, I ſhall premit ſome diſtinctions which make way for an anſwer to it. 1.<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Ruth.</hi> treatiſe of the Covenant. <hi>p.</hi> 2. c. 10.</note> It is a neceſſary diſtinction of the Covenant of grace, that it is conſidered, either, 1. As it is <hi>preached</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>commanding-will</hi> of God: or, 2. As it's <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> in the Elect, according to the Lords <hi>will of purpoſe:</hi> the Covenant in the firſt conſideration, ſtands of promiſes, commands, threatnings, &amp;c. And ſo it holds forth what is the command of God concerning our duty, and the things which we may conditionally expect; and puts nothing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, whether we perform it or not. See <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38.39, <hi>Then Peter ſaid unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt. For the promiſe is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> Act. 16.31, <hi>And they
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:58137:202"/>ſaid, Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thine houſe.</hi> In the ſecond conſideration, the Covenant ſtands wholly in promiſes, and thoſe abſolute promiſes, and does not hold forth our duty and obligation, and what is morally good or evil, becauſe God commands it, or forbids it: but what is Gods will of purpoſe and decree, and what is his pleaſure, to act effectually upon the hearts of the Elect, he over-ruling their corrupt wills: ſo the Covenant is to be underſtood, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.16, &amp;c. and 36.25, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt diſtinguiſh the parties of the Covenant, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this two-fold conſideration thereof: for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties contracting with God in the Covenant, under the firſt conſideration, are all thoſe who are within the viſible Church, whether Elect or Reprobate (and their ſeed) profeſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Goſpel-ordinances, under which they are (as I have at length proved elſe-where), <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20, <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob: his ſtatutes and his Judgments unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them.</hi> But the parties contracters with God in the Covenant, conſidered in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reſpect, are only the Elect of Chriſt; to whom the ſpirit is given, as well as the ordinances; to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the new heart is made, and in whom it is fulfilled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21, <hi>As for me, this is my covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, My ſpirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth, and for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We are to diſtinguiſh betwixt Chriſts act of Suretiſhip and undertaking; and ſome benefits which by concomitancy redound to them, for whom he never was made Surety: for many hypocrites and reprobates that have the Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by concomitancy, becauſe they are mixed with the Elect, in the habitable parts of the earth, and Societies of men, where theſe have their abode; yet Chriſt was never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker for them, nor doth the preaching of the Covenant come to them from Chriſt, as their Surety: but this benefit they have by Chriſts undertaking and Suretiſhip for the elect that are among them, and for the Elects ſake, concerning whom Chriſt
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:58137:202"/>undertook to preach the Covenant to them, and to fulfil it in them; therefore he is <hi>a light to the Gentiles,</hi> Iſa. 49.6. with <hi>Act.</hi> 13.26, <hi>Men and brethren, children of the ſtock of Abraham, and whoſoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this ſalvation ſent.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.15, <hi>For all things are for your ſakes, that the abundant grace might, through the thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of many, redound to the glory of God.</hi> Joh. 17.19, <hi>And for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo might be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, we anſwer to the queſtion; 1. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively. 1. Sure he was not made Surety,<note place="margin">Cat. Racov. de Prophet. Ch. munere.</note> Chriſt did not undertake for all Mankind, in whom was ever the breath of life, the Reprobate as well as the Elect, <hi>Cain</hi> as well as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, Judas</hi> as well as <hi>Paul,</hi> (as <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> tell us) for the Apoſtle's [all], 1 Tim. 2.6,<note place="margin">Jac. Arm. Orat. ſacdotio Chriſti, <hi>pag. 16, 17.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Who gave himſelf a ranſom for</hi> [all], <hi>to be teſtified in due time:</hi> can be no more than Chriſt's many. Mat. 20.21, <hi>And to give his life a ranſom for</hi> many, Heb. 9.28, <hi>So Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many; and unto them that look for him, ſhall he appear the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">Davenant. diſſect. de morte Chriſti, <hi>cap. 4. p. 48.</hi>
                  </note> Sure he was not Surety, nor did undertake for all theſe who are within the viſible Church, or within the Covenant externally: for many of theſe were neither given to him by the father, nor undertaken for by him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19, <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifeſt, that they were not all of us.</hi> Mat. 22.14, <hi>For many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> 3. He was not made Surety for all men conditionally, to wit, if they ſhould believe: for, 1. His Suretiſhip was an abſolute act of his own will and grace, and doth not depend upon our will, over which Chriſt hath the dominion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, <hi>All that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth me, ſhall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Zech. 10.8, <hi>I will hiſs for them, and gather them, for I have redeemed them.</hi> 2. It was part of his undertaking, to purchaſe by the meirt of his death, grace to bow our will, and to heal our nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10, <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, once for all.</hi> Iſa. 42.4, <hi>He ſhall not fail, nor be diſcouraged, till he have ſet judgment in the earth, and the Iſles
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:58137:203"/>ſhall wait for his law.</hi> 3. God knew them all particularly, whom he gave to Chriſt, to be ranſomed by him; and Chriſt knew them all by name, for whom he did undertake: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read of <hi>names written in the lambs book of life,</hi> Rev. 21.27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We anſwer affirmatively, That Chriſt undertakes in his bargain of Suretiſhip, only for the Elect, Chriſt from eternity came under an act of cautionry for all theſe and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>For, 1. No other were given to him by the Father: but theſe were given unto him, and without queſtion he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Surety for none but theſe who were given to him by his father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2, 19, <hi>That he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.— And for their ſakes I ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my ſelf.</hi> Joh. 6.37, <hi>All that the father giveth me, ſhall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Joh. 10.28, 29, <hi>And I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand. My father which gave them me, is greater then all: and no man is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He became Surety for none but for thoſe for whom he died, and in whoſe ſtead he anſwered the demands of the Law, and ſatisfied the Juſtice of God; now he died only for the Elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifieth. Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died; yea rather, that is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth interceſſion for us.</hi> Joh. 10.11, <hi>I am the good ſhepherd: the good ſhepherd giveth his life for the ſheep.</hi> 3. He did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for theſe only for whom he doth pray and intercede with God, and theſe were only the Elect, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.9, <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world: but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</hi> 4. He did undertake for theſe only, for whoſe believing his father did undertake to him, and theſe were only the Elect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11, <hi>And the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied: by his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many: for he ſhall bear their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> 5. He did undertake for theſe only, in whom the Covenant is fulfilled, upon whoſe hearts it is really acted, ſo
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:58137:203"/>that a new heart is given to them, and life eternal, and theſe were only the Elect, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32, 33, <hi>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to hring them out of the land of Egypt, which my covenant they break, although I was an husband to them, ſaith the Lord. But this ſhall be my covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, after theſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my law in their inwards parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> Joh. 17.6, <hi>I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me; and they have kept thy word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is as ſad news to many of you who heard this Goſpel, as it is glad news to theſe who receive it, and believe in Chriſt: wo to them who have not this undertaker for them, for the Law muſt have a ſatisfaction by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal undoing of all theſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us conſider for what Chriſt is engaged by his Suretiſhip: That this may appear, we ſhall take notice of ſome diſtinctions, which ſpeak the extent of his undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his people. He was a Surety and undertaker, 1. In his ſtate, and in his actions. 2. In Earth, and in Heaven. 3. In our ſtead, and in our behalf. 4. To us-ward, and to God-ward.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, Chriſt is a <hi>Surety</hi> for his people, in his <hi>ſtate,</hi> and in his <hi>actions:</hi> that is, 1. In whatſoever ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Chriſt was, in that ſtate and condition he doth ſuſtain our perſons, and is ſurrogate in our place and condition, (for ſo much his Suretiſhip doth import, as I have already ſhewed) when he was in a ſtate of <hi>humiliation</hi> here, upon the earth, in that low condition, he did ſuſtain the perſons, and bear and repreſent the ſtate and condition of his poor broken people: he was ſurrogated a Surety to ſuſtain their <hi>Legal ſtate,</hi> or the ſtate wherein they are by the violation of the Law and Covenant of works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, <hi>Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much then as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.</hi> Gal. 4.4, <hi>But when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:58137:204"/>the law.</hi> Rom. 8.3, <hi>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> Again, in his <hi>exaltation,</hi> Chriſt doth ſuſtain the perſons, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the condition of the Elect, unto the which they are advanced by the Covenant through him: and therefore the Scripture holds him forth in his reſurrection and aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. as repreſenting the ſtate of the Elect: He is in heaven this day, ſaith the Scripture, <hi>for us,</hi> ſuſtaining our ſtate, and glorified condition, till we come there; taking poſſeſſion of our inheritance, unto which he hath acquired for us a right, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20, <hi>Whither the fore-runner is for us entred, even Jeſus.</hi> Heb. 9.24, <hi>For Chriſt is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true: but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> 2. In his <hi>actions,</hi> he acted our parts; eſpecially in what he did, or in what befel him here upon the earth: for it was his end of coming down into this world to act our parts; and to have acted upon him, what ſhould have been done to us: he died as our Surety, and he aroſe as our Surety; Juſtice ſmote him as our Surety, he was taken into priſon, and to judgment, and was condemned as our Surety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing numbred among tranſgreſſors; and again, he was taken from the priſon and judgment, as our Surety, being juſtified when he payed the Debt; and by vertue of that communion which we had with him in all theſe actions of his, he being our Surety, and ſuſtaining our Law-place and room, by a juſt law, theſe things are reckoned unto our account, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he ſuſtained, and whoſe parts he acted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Rom. 4. laſt, <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed again for our juſtification.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18, <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe is that inſtance and parallel of Adams ſuſtaining the condition of all men,<note place="margin">Chriſt ſet forth. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> and therein being a type of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22, 48. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14, Fitly, and at large applied, by Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt was a Surety on <hi>Earth,</hi> and he is a Surety ſtill in <hi>Heaven:</hi> Chriſt is as well a Surety in his <hi>interceſſion,</hi> as he was in his <hi>death;</hi> for beſide all that Chriſt did upon earth
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:58137:204"/>for diſcharging his undertaking unto God for his people, he ſtands yet engaged in Heaven as an undertaker for them, and ſhall not be acquitted of all his engagements, until he have brought all the Elect company, as ſafe there as he came himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me: for thou lovedſt me before the foundation of the world.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22, <hi>By ſo much was Jeſus made Surety of a better Teſtament.</hi> After he hath made mention of the Suretiſhip of Chriſt, he inſtanceth in his interceſſion and continuing a Prieſt for ever, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23, 24, 25. Shewing, that becauſe he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged as a Surety, therefore he <hi>intercedes to ſave to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this may be yet more plain; conſider, 1. That the Suretiſhip of Chriſt, as it was acted in a free Covenant and tranſaction betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and Chriſt, doth not only relate unto the juſtification of the Elect, but alſo to their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his Soul, and ſhall be ſatisfied: by his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many; for he ſhall bear their iniquities.</hi> Rom. 5.9, 10, <hi>Much more then, being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son: much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſhall be ſaved by his his life.</hi> And therefore as long as the perſons of any for whom he died, remain ſtill unſaved, he is not acquitted of this Suretiſhip and engagement, but after that he hath payed a price to juſtice for them, there remains an obligation upon him, to bring theſe for whom he died to glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10, <hi>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſons unto glory, to make the captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings.</hi> 2. Conſider that the being part of his Covenant of Suretiſhip to be performed, as long as the perſons of any of the Elect are yet unſaved to the utmoſt, the performance of that which is behind of his engagements is aſcribed to his interceſſion, which he is now performing in heaven, and therefore he muſt intercede in Heaven, as Surety of the better Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22, to 25. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34, <hi>Who is he that condemneth?
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:58137:205"/>it is Chriſt that died, yea rather, that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> 3. Conſider, that unleſs he were a Surety in Heaven, and acted therein that Covenant-relation by his interceſſion, all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actings as Surety of the Covenant would be to little purpoſe for our behoof: for it is this part of his Suretiſhip that maketh his ſatisfaction to the Law effectual for the good of the Elect; this is it which putteth life in the death of him who died in our ſtead and room; and without this, the blood of the Surety had been ſhed in vain. For this is the very application of it, and ſprinkling the blood of the Covenant upon us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19, 20, 24, <hi>For when Moſes had ſpoken eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of Calves and Goats, with water and ſcarlet wool, and Hyſop, and ſprinkled both the book and all the people, ſaying, this is the blood of the Teeſtament which God hath enjoined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.—For Chriſt is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true: but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 7.22, 25. <hi>By ſo much was Jeſus made Surety of a better Teſtament.—Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1, 2, <hi>My little children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not: and if any man ſin, we have an advocate with the father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 4. Conſider, that as his ſoul and his life was at the ſtake, and was pawned for that part of his Suretiſhip that was to be performed on earth, to wit, the paying of a price to Juſtice: ſo his honour lies yet at the ſtake and in pawn for that part of his engagement which is to be performed in heaven by his interceſſion: ſo that as it behoved him to have lien in priſon for ever, and the ſoul to have been left in the grave, unleſs he had payed his Debt, and made ſatisfaction to Juſtice, his Soul being in our ſouls ſtead as a Surety, ſo his honour (I ſay) lieth ſtill at the ſtake for all his peoples compleat Salvation: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that Heaven cannot hold him if he bring not them there, he ſhall not have the glory of a perfected Saviour and Surety, if he perform not his engagement to ſave them to the utmoſt; yea, he muſt quit heaven if he bring not his
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:58137:205"/>people thither, for whom he undertook, See <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.57, <hi>As the living father hath ſent me, and I live by the father: ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi> Joh. 17.1, 4, 12, 24, <hi>Glorifie thy ſon, that thy ſon alſo may glorifie thee.—I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.—While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: thoſe that thou gaveſt me, I have kept, and none of them is loſt, but the ſon of perdition, that the ſcripture might be fulfilled. Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me: for thou lovedſt me before the foundation of the world,</hi> Heb. 2.10, <hi>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſons unto glory, to make the captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings.</hi> He ſpeaks for his brethren as <hi>Judah</hi> did for little <hi>Benjamin, Gen.</hi> 43.9. 3. Chriſt is a Surety in our <hi>ſtead,</hi> and in our <hi>behalf.</hi> 1. I ſay, in moſt things which Chriſt did as a Surety of the Covenant, he did them in our ſtead and room; he did them as a perſon repreſenting us; and we did them in him by vertue of that communion that is betwixt the Surety and the Debtor: when he died, he died in our ſtead, and we died in him; there we paid the Debt: when he aroſe and aſcended, he roſe in our ſtead, and we roſe and aſcended in him; there we had a diſcharge and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration when he had it, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6, 8, <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.—Now if we be dead with Chriſt, we believe that we ſhall alſo live with him.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22, <hi>For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> Eph. 2.5, 6, <hi>Even when we were dead in ſins, he hath quickened us together with Chriſt (by grace ye are ſaved); and hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 2. Yet there are ſome things which Chriſt the Surety performed wholly for us indeed, and on our behalf; but he cannot be ſaid to perform them in our ſtead, or to act our part in them, that is, to act theſe things as that which we ſhould have done: ſuch was his incarnation and taking of our nature upon him, and the taking of our Law-place upon him, which were acts of Chriſt the Surety of the Covenant, and unto which he
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:58137:206"/>had voluntarily engaged himſelf by his Covenant of Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Tho. Goodwin,</hi> Chriſt ſet forth. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. c. 4. pag. 149.</note>

But made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of men.</hi> Such alſo is his interceſſion in heaven: for though he intercede as a Surety in Heaven, and on our behalf; yet he doth it not in our ſtead: for it cannot be ſaid that we intercede in him: for this is the accompliſhment of all the work, and ſo proper to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only as Mediator, being the Crown of all his works of Mediation.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant, is a Surety <hi>for God to man:</hi> that is, he who made faith upon the Covenant on Gods behalf, who is engaged to make good all the promiſes thereof to us:<note place="margin">De Luſhington comment. ad Heb. <hi>7.22.</hi> Grotius ad. Heb. <hi>7.22.</hi>
                  </note> and upon this head the <hi>Socinians</hi> and we differ not; for in this ſenſe the Apoſtle calleth Jeſus the <hi>Surety of a better Teſtament</hi> (though not only in this ſenſe as they affirm), <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. And in this ſenſe Jeſus may be called Surety of the Covenant, for four reaſons, or in four reſpects: 1. As he is a party contracting on Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half with his people, becauſe Chriſt is he who makes the Covenant and all the promiſes; he who contracteth a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us in his fathers name. He is the <hi>Angel of the Covenant,</hi> Mal. 3.1. who ſaid to Moſes, <hi>I am the God of thy
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:58137:206"/>fathers,</hi> Act. 7.32, 38. 2. As he is undertaker and engager for God, to make his promiſes good to us; becauſe he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh on Gods part, that all his promiſes ſhall be made good and effectual to us-ward. Therefore we find that theſe Scriptures of the old Teſtament, which promiſe the fulfilling of the Covenant in the Elect, and the acting of it upon their hearts, the promiſes of a <hi>new heart,</hi> and of <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> and <hi>perſeverance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. and 32.39, 40. The making of theſe promiſes, and undertaking for Gods making them good, is aſcribed to Chriſt by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 3. As he is performer of what God hath promiſed: becauſe Chriſt doth not only undertake for God, but he diſchargeth his undertaking for him, by fulfilling theſe promiſes; for Chriſt is he who performeth and fulfilleth the promiſes of God unto his people, even he who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to Moſes in the Buſh, and had an active hand in the delivery of his Church out of Egypt, whereby he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the promiſe made to Abram, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.14. This was he that ſaw their affliction, and came down to deliver, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.34. And was with them all the way in the Wilderneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.21. This is he who is advanced above <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a more ſpiritual and effectual Miniſter and Prieſt, who acteth the Covenant on his peoples hearts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6, 10. 4. As he is confirmer of the Covenant, becauſe he ratified it on Gods part: for in him all the promiſes thereof <hi>are yea, and in him they are Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. For as they are made to him <hi>eminently</hi> as the chief heir of the promiſes; and for him, as he by whoſe merit the grace promiſed is given to us, and ſo alſo the promiſes are made firm and ſtable to us in him and through him, who did ratifie the Covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15, 17, 19, <hi>Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men: though it be but a mans covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſannul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, or addeth thereto. And this I ſay, that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, till the ſeed ſhould come to whom the promiſe was made.</hi> Heb. 9.16, 17, <hi>For where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death of the Teſtator.

                  </note> Chriſt is Surety of the Covenant for mans part to God: this is denied by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who will have him <hi>Surety</hi> of the Covenant <hi>only</hi> in the ſenſe before mentioned: and upon the matter the ſame is denied by <hi>Arminians</hi> alſo. Let us endeavour to clear and eſtabliſh the truth.</p>
               <p>We may ſum up Chriſts Suretiſhip for man to God in theſe three parts: The firſt relates unto the violation of the Law, and broken Covenant of works. The ſecond unto the performance of the Condition of the new Covenant; yea, even of the preceptive part of the Law and Covenant, in ſo far as it ſtands in force towards believers. The third relateth unto the perſons of thoſe for whom he hath undertaken what the Law did threaten,<note place="margin">Cautions.</note> and what the Goſpel doth command. In all theſe three parts of his Suretiſhip, 1. We are ſtill to diſtinguiſh his undertaking from his diſcharging of that which he undertook: for in all thing appertaining to his Suretiſhip, he did firſt undertake (as I have ſhewed) by an eternal agreement with his father, and afterwards he did fulfil and diſcharge his undertaking. 2. We are to conſider, that though his undertaking in all theſe parts of his Suretiſhip for man, was at once by one eternal act and Covenant of Suretiſhip with God; yet his diſcharging of that undertaking, is brought about in different periods of time, ſo as at one time he ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies for the breach of the firſt Covenant: at another time he fulfilleth the condition of the new Covenant in his people, and at another time he fulfilleth what he undertook concerning their perſons, to ſave them compleatly, which may remain unperformed when the former two are diſcharged. For it was not the intent of God, that by Chriſts Suretiſhip the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:58137:207"/>ſinner ſhould be immediately delivered from the whole curſe of the Law, and inveſted in the whole bleſſing of the new Covenant. 3. There is an order of Chriſts diſcharging his intire Suretiſhip for the Elect: for Chriſts ſatisfaction to the Law goes before the new Covenant, and treating of new conditions for the ſinner: there can be no treating on new terms till the old be ſatisfied; and again, both theſe go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the performance of ſome things which Chriſt the Surety hath undertaken concerning the perſons of the Elect: for a perſon looſed from the law, and married to another hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, may yet remain without a performance of ſome things which Chriſt hath undertaken for him: whereof read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.3, to 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. and 3.21, 25. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p>And, 1. Of Chriſts Suretiſhip <hi>for man to God,</hi> as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the violated Covenant of works: this comprehends two things: 1. Chriſts <hi>ſurrogation</hi> in our place, whereby he put himſelf in our room, and took upon him our Law-place and Condition, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, He was <hi>made under the law;</hi> he put his Soul in our Souls ſtead, ſo that he might be in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Legally, wherein we had put our ſelves through our non-performance of the Covenant of works, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21, <hi>He was made ſin for us.</hi> He ſtood in the ſinners Law-place: for having by his Suretiſhip put his name in our bond, then he was in our ſtead as the Scripture ſpeaks of Sureties, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44.23. 2. This comprehends Chriſts <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> who being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute in our ſtead and place, did undergo the penalty and curſe of the violated Law, and ſo did perfectly ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for our non-performance of the Condition of the Covenant of works. In regard of this ſatisfaction, it is, that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6, <hi>The Lord laid upon him the iniquities of us all:</hi> that is, not the evil and pollution of them (for Chriſt was not intrinſecally and phyſically the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner), but the guilt and penalty belonging to them (for he was Legally the ſinner); and God charged it upon him as the <hi>Creditor</hi> chargeth a Debt upon the <hi>Surety,</hi> requiring a ſatisfaction of him. The like equivalent expreſſions, we find, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, <hi>He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted;</hi> or as the words may be rendered, <hi>it was exacted: and he anſwered:</hi> that is, God required ſatisfaction for our ſins, and his Son
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:58137:208"/>(as our Surety) anſwered for us, <hi>Lo, I come,</hi> Heb. 10.5, 7. Their curſe be upon me; let the law exact, and I will anſwer;<note place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Only ere I leave this, let me leave with you theſe three advertiſements concerning Chriſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our violation of the Covenant of works.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though our puniſhment and ſuffering ſhould have been eternal, becauſe we could never out-ſatisfie; yet the ſufferings of Chriſt, becauſe of the dignity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>God-man,</hi> were perfectly ſatisfactory in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt payed not the <hi>idem,</hi> but the <hi>tantundem;</hi> not the ſame that was <hi>due,</hi> but the <hi>value:</hi> for he ſuffered not the ſame pain, <hi>numero</hi> in number, but <hi>ſpecie</hi> in kind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet its one and the ſame ſatisfaction in the Laws ſenſe, which Chriſt payed, and which we owed, in reſpect that the Law doth not require of the Surety to pay the ſame ſum in number, which the Debtor borrowed: 'tis ſatisfaction, if the ſame <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> in kind, or in value be paid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another part of Chriſts Suretiſhip for <hi>man to God,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth to the condition and commands of the new Covenant: for Chriſt is not only Surety for ſatisfying the violated Law, and broken Covenant of works <hi>for us,</hi> that is, in our ſtead; but he is alſo Surety for performing of the Condition and Commands of the Goſpel and new Covenant <hi>in us,</hi> that is, for our performing of them through his grace working in us, (for the act is ours though we be acted by grace) and for our obedience to the preceptive part of the Law, which is not annulled, nor repealed, but ſtands yet in force towards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, he is Surety to God for our performance of the condition and commands of the Goſpel or new Covenant: and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:58137:208"/>this reacheth unto all things whatſoever, which are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel as conditions of righteouſneſs and life; all which he undertaketh to work in us, and ſo far to inable us to endeavour theſe things, that in the performance thereof we ſhall be accepted, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13, <hi>For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> Phil. 4.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> 2 Cor. 9.8, <hi>And God is able to make all grace abound towards you, that ye always having all ſufficiency in all things, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound to every good work.</hi> And this is his undertaking, for grace to be given unto us out of the ſtore-houſe and treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his fulneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16, <hi>And of his fulneſs have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi> Col. 2.9, 10, <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily. And ye are compleat in him, which is the head of all principality and power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More particularly: by this part of Chriſts Suretiſhip for <hi>man to God,</hi> he is engaged, and he is undertaker: 1. For our believing, that we ſhall come and ſubject our conſent unto the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, <hi>All that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth me, ſhall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Joh. 12.32, <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</hi> 2 Cor. 9.13, <hi>Whiles by the experiment of this miniſtration, they glorifie God for your profeſſed ſubjection unto the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> 2. For our obedience, that we ſhall bring forth the fruits of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and new obedience, that we ſhall ſerve him from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Love, who was made Surety for us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, <hi>And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes: and ye ſhall keep my judgments, and do them.</hi> Heb. 8.6, 7, 10, 11. Joh. 17.6, <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me; and they have kept thy word.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14, 15, <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judg, that if one died for all, then were all dead. And that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi> 3. For our perſeverance: Chriſt as Surety ſtands engaged for the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the weak believer, that his faith ſhall not fail, but that he ſhall endure unto the end, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32, <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> John 17.12,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:58137:209"/>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, by this part of Chriſts Suretiſhip, he is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker and engager, to make all theſe things which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us, both poſſible and certain in the performance. 1. To reveal and manifeſt the way of righteouſneſs and life, through the new Covenant, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6, <hi>I have manifeſted thy name unto the men, which thou gaveſt me out of the world.</hi> 2. To make the condition of the new Covenant, poſſible and practicable, which conſidered with relation to our own ſtrength, are as impoſſible to man now, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the firſt Covenant are, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, <hi>No man can come to me, except the father which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5, <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves: but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> Joh. 15.5, <hi>For without me ye can do nothing.</hi> And this part of Chriſts Suretiſhip doth put his people in ſuch condition, by the power which they ſhall receive from the grace of Chriſt, as <hi>Adam</hi> was in, by the power which he received from God by nature; and this is done by healing our nature, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and infuſing new habitual grace, whereby he makes the conditions of the new Covenant practicable and poſſible to man through the power of grace received from Chriſt; as it was poſſible for <hi>Adam</hi> to have performed the conditions of the firſt Covenant, by the power which he received by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> But this is not all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt as Surety for man to God, engageth not only to make the conditions of this Covenant poſſible (as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the firſt Covenant were to <hi>Adam</hi>); but alſo to make them Sure; he undertaketh to enſure his peoples per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the things required of them by the Covenant of grace, whether they be ſuch things as are required of them by meer commands which hold forth the Duties of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates; or if they be required of them by commands which are alſo conditions of the Covenant, by the obedience or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience whereof they muſt live or die; ſuch as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of believing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36, <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life; and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:58137:209"/>not ſee life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Act. 16.31, <hi>And they ſaid, Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thine houſe.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23, <hi>And this is his commandment, that we ſhould believe in the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this which Chriſt engageth that his people ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him through grace, is much more than <hi>Adam</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by nature; for he had not his performance of the conditions of that Covenant, and his ſtanding enſured to him: he had but a poſſibility to have performed conditions that were commanded him, but no certainty. Now we know that things may be poſſible, both conſidered in themſelves, and conſidered with relation to the Agent; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding from ſome other cauſe and defect, may reſolve in a non-futurition; yea, for all that, it may be certain that they ſhall never be, and come to paſs, as was <hi>Adams</hi> ſtanding and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the conditions of the Covenant of works. But now by Chriſts Suretiſhip for his people, he is engaged for their ſtanding, and for their actual performance of the conditions of that Covenant of grace, they are not only put into a poſſibility of ſtanding, but they are put into ſuch a certainty by the Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt, that they are exempted from the poſſibility of non-performance of the conditions of this Covenant, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32, <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> Mat. 16.18, <hi>And upon this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5, <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation, ready to be revealed in the laſt time.</hi> Jer. 32.39, 40, <hi>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, of their children after them. And I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good: but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. By this part of Chriſts Suretiſhip for <hi>man to God,</hi> and in order to the making the conditions and commands of the new Covenant poſſible and certain in the iſſue, he is engaged for giving <hi>habitual grace,</hi> and for giving <hi>actual influences.</hi> 1. Habitual grace, Chriſt as Surety of the Covenant did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to give to his people the immortal ſeed of God, to repair that defaced Image of God in man, by a new creation of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:58137:210"/>the habits of grace in him: he is engaged to give a new ſtock of grace to man, who had once before banquered out; a ſtock that ſhall thrive in his hand; and wherewith he ſhall never henceforth play the bankrupt: this is the new heart, and the new ſpirit promiſed by Chriſt who made the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and engaged to fulfil, and to act it upon the hearts of his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Chriſt is engaged, and hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for actual influences, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36, 27, <hi>And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments, and do them.</hi> Iſa. 44.3, <hi>For I will pour water upon them that are thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine off-ſpring.</hi> Becauſe God hath contrived the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo, that no created thing ſhould act independently of him, without the ſpirit, without influences; not <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity, not the Angels, not the holy humane nature of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 2, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth: I have put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to be heard in the ſtreet.</hi> And ſince habitual created grace can neither preſerve it ſelf, nor act it ſelf, nor encreaſe it ſelf without influences, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt as Surety for man to God, did engage for actual influences, whereby habitual grace might be acted, unto a performance and fulfilling of theſe things which are conditions or commands in the Covenant upon our part: and by this he ſtands engaged, 1. For actual bowing of our wills, and determining our hearts to believe, and to believe to the end; to draw forth theſe habits to act lively, ſound faith, the firſt act whereof is a performance of the condition of the new Covenant, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, <hi>All that the father giveth me, ſhall come to me.</hi> Joh. 12.32, <hi>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me,</hi> 2. He ſtands engaged for the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:58137:210"/>preſervation of theſe habits of grace, that howſoever they may be weakened, and it may be alſo dimniſhed through our ill uſing of that ſtock, yet they ſhall never be loſt, neither ſhall the ſtock of habitual grace come to nothing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32, <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9, <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him: and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> 3. He ſtands engaged for our uſing and exerciſing habitual grace, after that he hath freely given it, that he ſhall by actual influences make us trade with thoſe talents, and not ſuffer them to lie by us, without making uſe of them. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, <hi>And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes; and ye ſhall keep my Judgments, and do them.</hi> Pſal. 119.32, 35, <hi>I will run the way of thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart.—Make me to go in the path of thy commandments: for therein do I delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt is engaged for the livelineſs of our graces: that he ſhall not only keep them from dying, but ſhall keep them in good condition, freſh and green, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3, <hi>And he ſhall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon: his leaf alſo ſhall not wither, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth ſhall proſper,</hi> Joh. 4.19, <hi>Yet a little while, and the world ſeeth me no more: but ye ſee me: becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> Pſal. 92.12, 13, 14, <hi>The righteous ſhall flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh like the Palm-tree: he ſhall grow like a Cedar in Lebanon.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt is engaged for the encreaſe and growth of theſe habits of grace, to make our ſtock to grow among our hands, to make our faith, love, diligence in duty; delight in God, knowledg of himſelf, &amp;c. to grow, and our fruit to abound and to grow in quantity and quality, in bigneſs and ripeneſs, more fruit, and ſweeter fruit, more ſavory to his taſte, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8, <hi>And God is able to make all grace abound towards you, that ye always having all ſufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.</hi> Joh. 15.4, 5, <hi>Abide in me, and I in you: as the branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the Vine: no more can ye, except ye abide in me.

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt ſtands engaged for our up ſtirring; when we have given his work in us a back-ſet, and brought grace to a low ebb: when we have contracted lazineſs, and a numneſs of ſpirit upon our ſelves, ſo that we either drive heavily, or cannot ſtir at all in his ways; he is engaged to oil our wheels, that we may recover a ſweet facility and eaſineſs in his ways: and to blow upon us, when we are calmed, and cannot fetch the wind to our ſelves, <hi>Song.</hi> 4.16, <hi>Awake, O North wind, and come thou ſouth, and blow upon my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out: let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleaſant fruits.</hi> Song. 5.4, <hi>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the dore, and my bowels were moved for him.</hi> Song. 6.12, <hi>Or ever I was aware, my ſoul made me like the charrets of Aminidab.</hi> Iſa. 64.5, <hi>Thou metteſt him that rejoiceth and worketh righteouſneſs, thoſe that remember thee in thy ways. Behold, thou art wroth, for we have ſinned: in thoſe is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi> I ſay, that Chriſt ſtands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, not only for our performance of Goſpel-conditions and commands, but alſo for our obeying and performing the preceptive part of the Law: for clearing of this, I ſhall lay down theſe five aſſertions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Law, as it commandeth and directeth obedience accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of the Law-giver, is not repealed, annulled, or abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Chriſt and by the Goſpel: though the Law conſidered as a Covenant, holding forth obedience to the commands thereof, as a poſſible way of Life, be annulled and abrogated: See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20, 23, 28, <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight: for by the law is the knowledg of ſin.—For all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God.—Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith, without the deeds of the law.</hi> Rom. 8.3, <hi>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Law which firſt commanded perfect obedience as a poſſible way of life, may be, and is continued for other uſes
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:58137:211"/>and ends than for that: ſuch as to direct, command, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit, promiſe, threaten, and to prove the loyalty even of Chriſts Subjects, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27, 31, <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is excluded: by what law? of works? nay: but by the law of faith.—Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we eſtabliſh the law.</hi> Rom. 7.7, 9, 12, <hi>Nay, I had not known ſin, but by the law: for I had not known luſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.—For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and I died.—Wherefore the Law is holy, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment holy, and juſt, and good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Law as it is continued, and in force towards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is reduceable to the new Covenant, and doth more properly appertain to it, than to the Covenant of works: For, 1. It is the law, as 'tis delivered up and put into the hands of Chriſt to be managed and uſed by him, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his Subjects and Kingdom, by the new Covenant; and that is for other uſes and ends than thoſe for which it was firſt given, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19, 21, 24, 25, <hi>Wherefore then ſerveth the law? it was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions, till the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>een a law given, which could have given life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the law.—Wherefore the law was our School-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a School-maſter.</hi> Rom. 10.4, <hi>For Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth.</hi> 2. 'Tis the Law as its qualified by Chriſt, who gave out a new edition of the commands thereof (without detracting from the old) as his Law in the new Covenant, whereby his Subjects might know his will, which they muſt endeavour to obey, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.34, <hi>A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye alſo love one another.</hi> Mat. 5.17, 21, 22, 27, 28, <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfil.—Ye have heard, that it was ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not kill: and whoſoever ſhall kill, ſhall be in danger of the Judgment. But I ſay unto you, That whoſoever is angry with his brother
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:58137:212"/>without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the Judgment: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall ſay to his brother, Racha, ſhall be in danger of the Counſel: but whoſoever ſhall fay, Thou fool, ſhall be in danger of Hell-fire.—Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old time, thou ſhalt not commit adultery. But I ſay unto you, that whoſoever looketh on a woman to luſt after her, be hath committed adultery with her already in his heart,</hi> &amp;c. And this new giving out of the commands and preceptive part of the Law and Covenant of works, did neither derogate from the ſubſtance of the Law, nor from the authority and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force thereof, by vertue of the firſt Covenant, to which it did appertain; but did rather ſuper add a new and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive obligation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15, <hi>For the love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judg, that if one died for all, then were all dead. And that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe again.</hi> Rom. 6.1, 2, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we continue in ſin, that grace may abound? God forbid: how ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Though the Law and preceptive part of the Covenant of works doth appertain to the new Covenant, yet are not the commands and conditions thereby required, and the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience given thereunto, conditions of the new Covenant, which ſtandeth only of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 16, <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.—Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.</hi> Act. 16.31, <hi>And they ſaid, Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thine houſe.</hi> For, 1. This were upon the matter to confound the conditions of the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, which are ſtated as ſo contra-diſtinguiſhed in terms, that there is no mixture nor ſemblance of mixture to be admitted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32, <hi>But Iſrael which followed after the law of righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law: for they ſtumbled at that ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtone.</hi> Rom. 10.3, 4, 6, 8, <hi>For they being ignorant of Gods
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:58137:212"/>righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the righteouſneſs of God. For Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth,</hi> &amp;c. 2. If this obedience to the preceptive part of the Law, which is yet of force to believers, and required by the Goſpel, were the condition of the new Covenant, then perfect obedience to the Law ſhould ſtill be the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new Covenant, foraſmuch as the Law doth ſtill command that to believers, and it is their ſin that they do not come up to the obedience thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21, <hi>I do not fruſtrate the grace of God: for if righteouſneſs came by the law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> Rom. 7, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſts undertaking to God for our ſubjection and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Law, is not ſo to be underſtood, as if he had undertaken that the Law ſhould have perfect obedience from us, and in us, in this life: for if he had been Surety for that, it ſhould alſo have been performed. But by his Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for our obedience to the law, we mean, 1. That he hath undertaken for our ſubjection to it as a rule, unto which his people ſhall ſubmit, and whereof they ſhall accept, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75, <hi>That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him with out fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12, <hi>Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and juſt, and good.</hi> Pſal. 119.97, <hi>O how love I thy law: it is my meditation all the day.</hi> 2. For the univerſality of our obedience to it, that our obedience ſhall be equable and uniform, and that there ſhall not one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it be ſlighted by his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, <hi>And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgments, and do them.</hi> Pſal. 119.6, 128, <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed: when I have reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all thy commandments.—Therefore I eſteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right: and I hate every falſe way.</hi> 3. For the ſincerity of our obedience, that ſhall ſincerely obey and fulfil the commands of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17, <hi>But God be thanked, that ye were the ſervants of ſin: but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you.</hi> 4. For the reality and ſeriouſneſs in the obedience thereof, that we ſhall labour and work as hard at obedience
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:58137:213"/>to the Law, as if we had not another righteouſneſs, nor poſſible way of life; and that our love to him ſhall put us on to carry thus, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.29, <hi>Whereunto I alſo labour, ſtriving according to his working which worketh in me mightily.</hi> 5. For our deadneſs to the Law, and to our own obeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thereof, that when we work hardeſt, and ſweat moſt, that then we ſhall claim nothing upon that account, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21, <hi>I do not fruſtrate the grace of God: for if righteouſneſs come by the law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> 6. Chriſt hath undertaken that what ſatisfaction the Law wanteth in us, it ſhall have in him, who is the end of the Law: that he ſhall ſatisfie for our ſhort coming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> Rom. 10.4, <hi>For Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth.</hi> 7. Chriſt hath undertaken that he ſhall in all theſe performances make us ſo far to endeavour duty through his ſtrength, and be forth coming in obedience, that therein we ſhall be accepted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8, <hi>And God is able to make all grace abound towards you, that ye always having all ſufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.</hi> Joh. 15.5, <hi>I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Since the Law and Covenant of works is alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and requireth but that a man ſhould obey and perform the commands thereof, or elſe undergo the puniſhment and curſe threatned againſt the tranſgreſſors: how can it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us to perform the obedience to the Law, ſince Chriſt our Surety hath ſatisfied the Law, and endured the curſe and puniſhment thereof in our ſtead? how can it ſtand with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to exact both? In this <hi>Objection</hi> the <hi>Antinomian,</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,</hi> and the, <hi>Socinan</hi> concur, though for different ends, and upon different accounts.

               <p>In anſwer to this, we ſhall offer theſe conſiderations: 1. Chriſt did not fulfil the preceptive part of the Law in our ſtead, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> in that ſtrict ſenſe, that we ſay he did bear the puniſhment of the Law for us: for then ſhould all Duties ceaſe as well as ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and ranſome to offended Juſtice, which is contrary to the Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31, <hi>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we eſtabliſh the law.</hi> Ezek. 36.27, <hi>And I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſnall keep my judgments, and do them.</hi> And then alſo did Chriſt die and ſuffer in vain: for if we did perfectly fulfil the Law in Chriſt, then there is no need nor uſe of his ſuffering for diſobedience, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21, <hi>For if righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> Then alſo Chriſts Surety-righteouſneſs ſhould be ours, though we ſhould never believe: for what need we believe, if he did it for us, and if we did it in him, which is alſo contrary to the Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, <hi>But to him that worketh not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</hi> Rom. 10.9, 10, <hi>That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the obedience required of us unto the precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of the Law (for whom Chriſt did bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof): and in ſeveral reſpects it may appear to be conſiſtent with Juſtice, that even they for whom Chriſt died, ſhould be bound to obey the Law. 1. The believers obe dience which is required in his own perſon, is not that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which the Law required as a poſſible way of life, I mean a perfect obedience of a righteous perſon who had never ſinned, but an obedience of ſincerity that may be in a ſinner. 2. Our obedience is not for the ſame end that Chriſts ſufferings were (to wit, for a ſatisfaction to offended Juſtice), for its no part of our ranſome: but for other ends; and ſo it is not inconſiſtent with Juſtice to demand ſatisfaction of Chriſt for one uſe and end, and obedience of us for other uſes and ends. 3. Since the Law is not changed nor repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though our relation to it be changed, 'tis juſt that we ſhould obey Chriſt our head and husband, whoſe will this
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:58137:214"/>Law is: Notwithſtanding, that he hath divorced us by his ſufferings from the Law, as a husband commanding obedience, as the marriage-condition of life. 4. The Lord may juſtly require obedience to his Law from them, even in their own perſons, for the time to come, for whoſe tranſgreſſions he hath accepted of a ſatisfaction in the perſon of another; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when that obedience is nothing that can lie in the balance, as the juſt alternative of the Law, fornent the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction given by Chriſt. 5. The Law and Juſtice may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire both ſatisfaction and obedience in different reſpects, or in regard of different actions: for it is not the ſame thing which we obey, and for which Chriſt makes ſatisfaction: for he ſatisfied for our diſobedience, not for our obedience; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, Chriſts ſatisfaction is for diſobedience to the Covenant of works: our obedience even to the Law, is the obedience to the Goſpel-Covenant, to which the Law is reduced by Chriſt who hath made it his Law in this Covenant. 6. It cannot be ſuppoſed that Chriſts ſufferings for our diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law, ſhould put us thereafter in another condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in reſpect of obedience to the Law, than <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have been in, if he had never ſinned, and if his life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs had not depended on his obedience; in both which caſes he had been bound to obey the Law and will of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.</p>
               <p>The third part of Chriſts Suretiſhip for man to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth to his undertaking for the perſons of the Elect, the former two parts being his undertakings for what the Law did threaten, and what the Goſpel and Law both do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: for he is not only a Surety for Debt and for Duty, for penalty of the Law, and for performance of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law and Goſpel, but alſo a Surety for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Elect: a Surety by way of caution, who did give bail for them all: and in relation to this part of his Suretiſhip, Chriſt is Surety.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the indempnity of all the Elect, that ſince the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given them into his hands, he hath engaged to loſe none of them: he is acted a cautioner to make a good account of all that company; that however he ſet them a warfare, and although he lead them on, and engage them againſt ſtrong adverſaries, and through manifold tentations, although
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:58137:214"/>he ſhew his people hard things; yet he ſhall bring them off ſafe, and bear them through, ſo that he may ſay he <hi>hath loſt none of them,</hi> Joh. 17.12. But is a <hi>captain of ſalvation</hi> to them all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.12, <hi>Thou haſt cauſed men to ride o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our heads: we went through fire, and through water; but thou broughteſt us out into a wealthy place.</hi> Such a Surety was <hi>Judah</hi> for little <hi>Benjamin,</hi> Gen. 43.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is Surety for the good behaviour of all thoſe whom he hath reconciled unto God: for having made our peace with God, he is Surety that we ſhall keep the peace: that howſoever we may fail in many things, yet his people being once reconciled to God, and pardoned their diſloyalty, they ſhall never break forth in open rebellion again: they ſhall never take up the arms again of enmity againſt God, which once they laid down, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6, <hi>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds: caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledg of God; and bringing into captivity every thought into the obedience of Chriſt: and having in a readineſs to avenge all diſobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</hi> Pſal. 45.5, <hi>Thine arrows are ſharp in the heart of the kings enemies, whereby the people fall under thee.</hi> Chriſt is Surety for his peoples loyalty, and keeping their peace, treaties, and Covenant with God inviolable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.9, 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt is Surety for the appearing of his people before God, that he ſhall preſent them all at the day appointed, and not one of them ſhall be miſſing, who ſhall not give his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at that day, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27, <hi>That he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot nor wrinkle, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing: but that it ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh.</hi> Col. 3.4, <hi>When Chriſt, who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt is Surety for compleating whatſoever concerns the Salvation of his people, and their redemption from thoſe evils which remain with them, after that he hath fulfilled and ſatisfied the Law for them, and hath alſo procured obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Goſpel in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption.</hi>

               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:58137:215"/>5. Becauſe there are many things remaining with them, from which they need a delivery, for compleating the diſcharge of his undertakings for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: ſo then, with the mind I my ſelf ſerve the law of our God: but with the fleſh, the law of ſin,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.53, to 57.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We ſhall take a view of ſome things which do commend Chriſts Suretiſhip, that the excellency thereof, and the matchleſs love which ſhineth forth in it, may the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This commendeth Chriſts Suretiſhip, that he rendred himſelf Surety, and came under an act of cautionry for his people, before they needed a cautioner; that upon the fore-knowledg of this, that it was to come to paſs that man ſhould become a broken creature, and needing one to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for him, he by an eternal tranſaction and agreement with his father, did ſo early provide this remedy, before man was broken and ſtood in need of a Surety, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23, <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9, <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This commendeth Chriſts Suretiſhip, that he came under this relation ſo freely, unrequeſted, and undeſired, according to his own heart: he acted himſelf cautioner for us, when there was none of the creatures once to hint ſuch a motion: that in the day when there was none found to help, nor ſo much as to think of laying help on him, then he freely offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, and ſaid, <hi>Lo I come:</hi> take me Surety for theſe poor broken men. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.</hi> Iſa. 63.5, <hi>And I looked, and there was none to help: and I wondred that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought ſalvation unto me: and my fury it upheld me.</hi> Iſa. 59.16, <hi>And he ſaw that there was no man, and wondred that there was no interceſſor: therefore his arm brought ſalvation unto him, and his righteouſneſs it ſuſtained him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The exceeding great reach and danger of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:58137:215"/>taking doth commend his Suretiſhip, that he put his name in ſuch a bond as he knew well ſhould bring upon him the Debt of ſo many broken men, and ſhould oblige him to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the ſins of all the Elect world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5, 6, 11, 12, <hi>But he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities: the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray; we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.—By his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many: for he ſhall bear their iniquities.—Becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death: and he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors.</hi> That he did knowingly put his ſoul in their ſouls ſtead, that Juſtice might ſmite him, and that the ſame eternal puniſhment of ſin, <hi>for kind,</hi> that was due to us, ſhould be upon him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us: for it is written, Curſed is every one that hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on a tree.</hi> Zech. 13.7, <hi>Awake, O ſword, againſt my ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and againſt the man that is my fellow, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> The ſame ſword of Divine Juſtice that ſhould have ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us, did ſmite him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This commendeth Chriſts Suretiſhip, that he engaged for a party which deſerved no pity, for man who had wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly forfeited a fair inheritance, when it was poſſible for him, and in his power to have performed the commands and conditions of life laid upon him; who would pity and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for ſuch a perſon, who being put into a fair and free inheritance, with power to perform the conditions upon which he holds it, ſhould notwithſtanding forfeit his good eſtate, and run himſelf under debt irrecoverably? yet in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Chriſt pitied us, and undertook for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8, <hi>For when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly. For ſcarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man ſome will even dare to die. But God commended his love toward us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This commendeth Chriſts Suretiſhip, that he engaged for the debt of a people from whom he could expect no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction nor relief of all the debt which he payed for them, that ſo potent and reſponſal a party joined intereſts, with
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:58137:216"/>ſuch impotent and unreſponſal, broken creatures: how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully doth this commend his Suretiſhip, that he came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an act of cautionry for ſuch as we are, knowing us to be what we are, a people that ſhall never requite his kindneſs? yea, doing all this for us the rather, that we ſhall be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in his debt, and never able to recompence the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he made for us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10, <hi>So likewiſe ye, when ye ſhall have done all theſe things which are commanded you, ſay, We are unprofitable ſervants; we have done that which was our duty to do.</hi> 2 San. 7.18, <hi>Then went king David in, and ſate before the Lord, and he ſaid, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my houſe, that thou haſt brought me hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> &amp;c!</p>
               <p n="7">7. Let us conſider wherein Chriſts Suretiſhip differeth from bonds and acts of cautionry uſual among men, whereby the excellency thereof may yet further appear.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

Chriſt had his fathers bond of relief to keep him harmleſs in that undertaking: he had, as it were, a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, that he ſhould not ſuccumb in his undertaking, but that when he went into the priſon, he ſhould come out again with honour and victory, and ſo ſhould be kept harmleſs from the hurt of the broken mans Debt.

Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great; and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong: becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death: and he was numbred with the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:58137:218"/>tranſgreſſors, and he bare the ſin of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Iſa. 42.1, 4, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth: I have put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.—He ſhall not fail, nor be diſcouraged, till he have ſet judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the earth: and the Iſles ſhall wait for his law.</hi> Pſal. 16.10, <hi>For thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell; neither wilt thou ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption,</hi> Pſal. 110, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>

               <p n="1">1. By Chriſts Suretiſhip we have our exemption and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Law, and the hand of Juſtice: our divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Law and Covenant of works as a husband, in which reſpect it is now dead and extinct (though it live for other ends and uſes), <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4, <hi>Wherefore my brethren,

By his Suretiſhip we have this new and better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-ſtate, wherein we ſtand: we owe our being in Chriſt, and in the Covenant of Grace, unto his Suretiſhip, who did undertake to bring about that bond of engagement betwixt God and us: for if Chriſt had not acted himſelf to do this, it had never been done: <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2, 6, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.—I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world: thine they were; and thou gaveſt them me; and they have kept thy word.</hi> Joh. 6.37, <hi>All that the father giveth me, ſhall come to me: and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>

My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I ſworn by my holineſs, that I will not lie unto David.</hi> Jer. 3.1, 14, 22, <hi>They ſay, If a man put away his wife, and ſhe go from him, and become another mans, ſhall he return unto her again? ſhall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers, yet return again to me, ſaith the Lord.—Turn, O back-ſliding children, ſaith the Lord, for I am married unto you: and I will take you, one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.—Return ye back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding children, and I will heal your back-ſlidings: behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> Jer. 31.37, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, If heaven above can be meaſured, and the foundations of the earth ſearched out beneath, I will alſo caſt off all the ſeed of Iſrael, for all that they have done, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Jer. 32.39, 40, <hi>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them.

Why do any of you think or ſay, that the Goſpel-conditions and commands are hard and heavy? that they are unprofitable or impoſſible? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8, <hi>But the righteouſneſs which is of faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe: ſay not in thine heart, who ſhall aſcend into heaven? that is to bring Chriſt down from above.

Why do you lean upon any thing, and ſeek relief from that which God hath not made the Surety of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? why do you take caution from your own hearts for any thing commanded in the Covenant? can your reſolutions be caution and Surety to God for you? can your ſtock of gifts or grace be Surety for your performance of any thing

If he hath acted the Covenant upon your hearts, according as it is commanded in the Goſpel, and according as its foretold, that he will fulfill it effectually in his people, then hath he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for you, and hereby you may know it for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> Ezek. 11.19, <hi>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new ſpirit within you: and I will take the ſtony heart out of their fleſh, and will give them an heart of fleſh.</hi> Ezek. 36.26, <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you,

If Chriſt hath taken your name out of the Law-writ and curſe, and hath put your name in the Goſpel-writ, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you bleſſed in that little book, or pronounced you ſuch by any thing contained in it, then hath he undertaken for you: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7, 8, <hi>Saying, Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered.

This doth alſo call for more quietneſs of mind in you: you are often diſquietted anxiouſly, that you do not reap the fruit of Covenant-promiſes, and that Goſpel-commands do not find that obedience in you, which is acknowledged to be due unto them; you have covenanted obedience to the Goſpel, and you are as an unjuſt Debtor through the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of your Covenant and promiſes; and this is your affliction, and makes you walk in heavineſs every day. I ſay, that Chriſts Suretiſhip doth call for quieting your minds, and to lay more weight upon his free undertakings, and leſs upon your own ſlippery performances (be it ſpoken without giving any colour to ſlack your hand in the beſt and utmoſt endeavours after duty): 1. Becauſe what obedience the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath not yet had in you, it ſhall have, ſince he is engaged for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. <hi>laſt, The Lord will perfect that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth me: thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever: forſake not the works of thine own hands.</hi> Iſa. 26.12, <hi>Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us, for thou alſo haſt wrought all our works in us.</hi> 2. What the Law and Goſpel cannot find in you, they ſhall have in him; and 'tis enough if it be ſound either in the Surety or the Debtor, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4, <hi>For Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> Rom. 8.3, <hi>For what the law could not do, in
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:58137:227"/>that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh</hi> Gal. 4.4, 5, <hi>But when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Som made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> 3. The Surety hath already ſatisfied for your diſobedience: it is not a thing to be done, but paſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, <hi>And for this cauſe is the Mediator of the new Teſtament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt teſtament, they which are called, might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi>

Learn hence a neceſſary cautiouſneſs (the neglect whereof is one chief cauſe of the miſgiving of our hearts in duties every day): do not put any thing in Chriſts place as Surety and undertaker for you. Sometimes we take our gifts and graces to be Surety for us, and we reckon that theſe may engage for us, and make us forth-coming in Duty; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we take our own hearts, and our reſolution, Surety for us; and we truſt to them as the people did, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.16, <hi>And the people anſwered, and ſaid, God forbid that we ſhould forſake the Lord, to ſerve other gods.</hi> Deut. 5.27, 29, <hi>Go thou near and hear all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, and ſpeak thou unto us all that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and we will hear it, and do it.</hi> Sometimes we take our own good frame Surety for us: if we have at any time ſome warmneſs and life under preſent influences, we reckon theſe may be Surety for us, and that is but to put ſomething in the Sureties place, which God hath not made cautioner in this Covenant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, 31, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption: that according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Chriſt the Teſtator of the new Covenant or Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</head>
               <p>THE ſeventh relation which Chriſt ſuſtains in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, he is <hi>Teſtator,</hi> or <hi>he that makes the will and teſtament,</hi> Heb. 9.16, 17.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe <hi>Teſtator</hi> and <hi>Teſtament</hi> are ſo nearly related, that the one is not underſtood without the other; I muſt here refer you to that which I have already ſpoken of Chriſts Teſtament, which being largely handled before, we ſhall not need to be large in ſpeaking of the Teſtator; but briefly of theſe particulars: 1. What this Name and Covenant-relation imports. 2. What was the deſign of this Covenant-relation. 3. How the thing deſigned in Chriſts being Teſtator in the new Teſtament or Covenant, is rendred effectual by his ſuſtaining this relation.</p>
               <p>And, 1. Of the name and relation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies a <hi>Diſpoſer</hi> or <hi>Teſtator,</hi> one that maketh his latter will and <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> one who according to his own will and pleaſure diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of his eſtate and goods, in contemplation of his death, and the leaving his poſſeſſion to be injoyed by others after his death.</p>
               <p>This Covenant-relation, that Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>Teſtator,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, 1. A perſon dying, or doing a deed in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the neceſſity of his own death, as being thereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: this relation ſpeaks Chriſt, under not only the common appointment unto death with all men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27, but under a ſpecial appointment unto death, for that end for which he made his Teſtament, which he well underſtood, and did often contemplate and remember, when he acted in this Covenant-relation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, 16, <hi>Where a teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death of the teſtator.</hi> And Joh. 13.1, <hi>Jeſus knew that his hour was come that he ſhould depart out of this world unto the father.</hi> 2. This relation imports a
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:58137:228"/>perſon veſted with poſſeſſion and right unto ſome eſtate or goods, whereof he makes a Diſpoſal and Will: for he that hath nothing in poſſeſſion nor in title, can diſpoſe of nothing to another perſon. Chriſt the Teſtator, is a perſon fully veſted with right unto, and poſſeſſion of all good things: <hi>for God hath made him both Lord and Chriſt,</hi> Act. 2.36. and 10.36, <hi>And him God hath appointed heir of all things.</hi> Heb. 1.2, <hi>It pleaſed the father, that in him all fulneſs ſhould dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. 3. This relation imports a power in the Teſtator, to diſpoſe of the things poſſeſſed by him; a power of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eſtate to others, elſe it were in vain to bequeath his eſtate real or perſonal; this relation ſpeaks Chriſt the Teſtator in power and authority, to convey all Covenant-bleſſings, which are his own, unto his people: <hi>for the father hath given all things unto his hands, and hath committed all judgment to the Son.</hi> Not a poſſeſſion only, but a power and authority, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.35. and 5.22. And hath <hi>given him power</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> authority <hi>over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as thou haſt given him,</hi> Joh. 17.2. 4. This relation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a Deed which is the ſole will, and meer pleaſure of the Teſtator, not only a power to diſpoſe of that which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth or hath right unto, but to do according to his meer pleaſure, and the Teſtators will to be the deviſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying of whatſoever is his own; and therefore inaſmuch as Chriſt is Teſtator in the Covenant, it is declared that his will in his Teſtament, his grace and pleaſure, makes the title and conveyance of what we have from and by him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24, <hi>Father, I will that theſe whom thou haſt given unto me, be with me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.27, <hi>My peace I give unto you.</hi> Joh. 16.7, <hi>I will ſend the comforter unto you,</hi> 5. This relation imports the actual declaring of his will, and diſpoſing of his goods: for a Teſtator is not a Teſtator, but in relation to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, or evidence by which he declares his will; to wit, his Teſtament. And therefore this relation holds forth Chriſt in the Covenant, as having actually already made his will by an authentick inſtrument and evidence; to wit, the old and new Teſtament: for Chriſt died not unteſted, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a declaration of his will, and a diſpoſal of his houſe, and of his goods, but hath ordered and diſpoſed all of things, and left us this authentick evidence of his will, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.29,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:58137:228"/>
                  <hi>And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my father hath appointed unto me.</hi> The ſame word that's uſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I <hi>diſpoſe</hi> or appoint by my will and Teſtament; and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.16, <hi>I will make with you a covenant,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; to wit, this teſtamentary Covenant: I declare my will of grace to you in it. 2. What was the deſign of Chriſts ſuſtaining the relation of Teſtator in the new Covenant? 1. That by this relation our Lord Jeſus might ſuper-add a new title to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, unto the new Covenant-bleſſings, which he would have his people to hold of him, after all manner of the beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity uſed among men; and therefore will not only convey theſe mercies to them by Covenant and promiſe, but by Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Legacy: therefore he ſuſtained the relation of a Teſtator, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.27, <hi>Peace I leave with you:</hi> to wit, by Legacy. 2. He ſuſtained this relat on, to declare the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute freeneſs of his grace, in the conveyance of Covenant-bleſſings, which howſoever covenanted and promiſed to us condition-ways, yet are purely deeds of Grace, and of the pleaſure and will of God, as all teſtamentary deeds are, which are the ſole will and meer pleaſure of the Teſtator, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24, <hi>Father, I will:</hi> and <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.29, <hi>I appoint unto you a kingdom.</hi> 3. He ſuſtained this relation for the ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that title and intereſt which believers have unto Covenant-bleſſings: for their holding, being by a deed of will and pleaſure, ſo long as he who diſpoſeth of his eſtate and goods is alive, his will is ambulatory and alterable: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is a Teſtator (which takes in the death of Chriſt, that his will of grace to his people declared in his Teſtament might be irrevocable): ſo the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15, <hi>Though it be but a mans teſtament, yet if it be confirmed</hi> (to wit, by his death) <hi>no man diſannulleth or addeth thereunto.</hi> Heb. 9.16, 17, <hi>For where a teſtament is, there muſt alſo of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be the death of the Teſtator. For a teſtament is of force after men are dead: otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all, whilſt the teſtator liveth.</hi> 4. Chriſt ſuſtained the relation of a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the new Covenant, to make way for a poſſeſſion of theſe Covenant-bleſſings, unto which his people have a right: he makes his Teſtament, and dies, that his will in his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be executed, which could have no execution till by his death (typical or real) and contemplation thereof, he
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:58137:229"/>declared a ceſſion of his poſſeſſion: that this was his very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, the Apoſtle-proves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, <hi>That by means of death—they which are called might receive the promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inheritance.</hi> Joh. 16.17, <hi>If I go not away, the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not come; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us conſider how this deſign hath its accompliſhment in Chriſts ſuſtaining the relation of Teſtator in the Covenant of Grace. And, 1. 'Tis unqueſtionable, that by this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Believers have a new active title to the Covenant-bleſſings; to wit, a teſtamentary title; they are his friends, and legators, and do hold their mercies as Legacies left to them by the latter will of Chriſt the Teſtator; his will of favour and grace is their title: ſo he often taught his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to remember their teſtamentary title to their mercies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25, <hi>This is my blood of the new teſtament, ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.21, <hi>The Son quickeneth whom he will. Jam.</hi> 1.18, <hi>Of his own will begat he us.</hi> Here is that title of will acknowledged, and the deſign of abſolute free-grace, in the Teſtator accompliſhed. 2. The deſign of God in Chriſts ſuſtaining the relation of a Teſtator in the Covenant of Grace, is accem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, in ſo far, as a ratification and confirmation of the teſtamentary Covenant is thereby intended: becauſe by Chriſts death, the right that believers have by this Teſtament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a threefold confirmation: 1. A confirmation of the <hi>verity</hi> and reality of it; that it is a true and real deed, which by the ſtricteſt tryal, <hi>for probat of Wills,</hi> cannot be rejected: for 'tis <hi>confirmed,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. to wit, to be an authentick inſtrument and evidence, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticatum, confirmatum &amp; ratum habitum,</hi> Act. 3.15. <hi>And killed the prince of life, whom God hath raiſed from the dead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are witneſſes.</hi> Luk. 24.48, <hi>And ye are witneſſes of theſe things.</hi> 2. A confirmation of <hi>validity,</hi> it is made unalterable, ſo that it cannot be diſannulled or abrogated thereafter; ſo that no man can make it void, or put any alteration upon it, as the Apoſtle proves, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15, <hi>No man diſannulleth, or addeth thereunto</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Nemo abrogat; eodem ſenſu quo leges dicuntur abrogari cum vim ſuam amittunt,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 7, 18, Chriſts Teſtament cannot be made void, and of none effect:
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:58137:229"/>for 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>teſtamentum ratum,</hi> Heb. 9.17. Firm and ſetled, as a pillar on its baſe. 3. A confirmation of <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy;</hi> it is made available to our uſe, as our evidence in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>it is of ſtrength,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.17. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>valet:</hi> But the next and <hi>third</hi> accompliſhment of the deſign of God in this Covenant-relation, will clear this further; to wit, the executing of Chriſts Teſtament, by his ceeding the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let us therefore conſider how Chriſts being Teſtator doth make way for thoſe that are called <hi>to receive the inheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Heb. 9.15.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt the Teſtator is veſted with the right and poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Covenant-bleſſings: for <hi>he is the firſt begotten of many brethren,</hi> Heb. 1.6. <hi>And God gave him to be head over all things to the Church.</hi> Col. 1.15, 17, 18, <hi>Who is the image of the inviſible God, the firſt born of every creature. And he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt. And he is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the firſt-born from the dead, that in all things he might have the preheminence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Teſtator by his Will and Teſtament, bequeaths, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſes, and leaves in legacy the very ſame mercies, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-bleſſings that were his at the firſt-hand, and all treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in the Mediator and Teſtator, as in a ſtore-houſe: <hi>Lo,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I give you the ſure mercies of David,</hi> Act. 13.34. with Iſa. 35.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Teſtator dies: when Chriſt hath made his Will, he laid down his life, and by his death he opens a way, and gives Legal acceſs to his people, to have his Teſtament executed, and his will therein actually fulfilled. 1. He renders up the poſſeſſion, and by a ceſſion yields it unto his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. The Mediator and Teſtator dies, <hi>that by means of death.—they which are called, might receive eternal inheritance:</hi> and <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7, <hi>If I do not go, the comforter will not come unto you,</hi> &amp;c. If the Teſtator had not died, there had never been room nor acceſs for them who are called, to receive the inheritance: though in this there be ſomething ſingular, and different from humane conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe Chriſt does ſo give up the poſſeſſion for his peoples acceſs to it, that he alſo keeps it for the ſame end, that he and they after ratifying his Teſtament by his death, may live and poſſeſs the inheritance together, <hi>as joint heirs
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:58137:230"/>with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. Joh. 14.2, 3. But in humane poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſions there is no room for two to poſſeſs the ſame thing by a compleat intire title to it; nor for a perſon that yields the poſſeſſion or inheritance to another, to return to it, without diveſting that perſon to whom it was reſigned. 2. The Teſtator himſelf pleads his Teſtament, and his making way through his death for his peoples coming at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the poſſeſſion of his goods: I ſay, he pleads that to be of force through his death, as a valid Legal right, that they alſo may now poſſeſs and injoy with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24, <hi>Father, I will that they may be where I am.</hi> And in Heaven <hi>he appears for us,</hi> and upon our account, in the force of the Teſtators death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 17.23, 24. 3. The Teſtator who before poſſeſt the inheritance upon his own right and title, does now poſſeſs the inheritance by a title ſuper-added to that; to wit, upon our account, as our <hi>Attorney,</hi> as one repreſenting the Elect, and having wrought for their heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, and come to heaven to be veſted with a poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their name, and for their account: for now <hi>he appears in heaven, in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9.24. And by the Teſtators being in Heaven, <hi>God hath made us ſit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 2.6. <hi>And he as a fore-runner is for us entered,</hi> Heb. 6.20. 4. The Teſtator ſurrogates his ſpirit in his abſence, and after his death, to ſee his Will executed in all points, and to give real and actual poſſeſſion of his Teſtament-bleſſings unto thoſe to whom he left them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26, <hi>But when the comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the father, he ſhall teſtifie of me:</hi> and Joh. 16.7, 8. Which accordingly is fulfilled, and our poſſeſſion <hi>quo ad exequnta,</hi> is aſcribed to this Executor ſurro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate by the Teſtator, and doing his will in his name, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11, <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God;</hi> the Executor of the Lord Teſtators will.</p>

That your right is teſtamentary, the Covenant betwixt God and Chriſt being turned unto a teſtament betwixt him and you, the bleſſings thereof are the abſolute will of the Teſtator, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.27, <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you: let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</hi> Joh. 17.24, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> 3. That
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:58137:231"/>there is force and ſtrength in his latter Will, by vertue of his death, that we can bring his Will as a valid deed of Law now after his death, and can plead it with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, 17, <hi>And for this cauſe he is the mediator of the new teſtament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt teſtament, they which are called might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.—For a teſtament is of force after men are dead: otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all whilſt the teſtator liveth.</hi> 4. That he hath left one to execute his Will; that the Teſtator wants not an Executor of his Teſtament, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26, <hi>But the comforter, which is the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoſt, whom the father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> Joh. 15.26, <hi>But when the comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the father, even the ſpirit of truth, which proceedeth from the father, he ſhall teſtifie of me.</hi>

Search (I ſay) after the experimental knowledg of vertue of Chriſts Teſtatorſhip, 1. <hi>Quo ad executionem,</hi> in the force and efficacy of it, that through the Teſtators death his Teſtament hath been executed and fulfilled as to thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.17, <hi>For a teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of force after men are dead: otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all whilſt the teſtator liveth.</hi> Zech. 9.11, <hi>As for thee alſo, by the blood of thy covenant, I have ſent out thy priſoners out of the pit wherein there is no water.</hi> 2. <hi>Quo ad executa,</hi> in the latitude of his Legacies, that nothing diſpoſed and bequeathed to believers in Chriſts Teſtament, hath eſcaped thee; that no part of his goods which is the portion of his people, be wanting with thee, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, <hi>And beſides this, giving all diligence, add to your faith vertue, and to your vertue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi>

               <p>BEſides the many and various relations before ſpoken of, which Chriſt ſuſtaineth in the Covenant of grace, he is the Covenant it ſelf: for to him doth the father ſpeak, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, and 49.8, <hi>I will give thee for a Covenant of the people:</hi> things attributed in <hi>abſtracto,</hi> have a great ſignification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7, <hi>The carnal mind is enmity,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt is called <hi>the peace, Micah.</hi> 5.5. <hi>And our peace, Eph.</hi> 2.14. This is more than the <hi>peace-maker, Col.</hi> 1.20. 'Tis all the tranſaction of peace, the whole buſineſs of reconciliation comprized in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and acted by him. So here Chriſt <hi>a Covenant,</hi> is more than the Covenant-maker, or the Mediator of the Covenant; the phraſe imports two things: 1. The abridging and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up of the whole Covenant in Chriſt Mediator; in whoſe perſon the two parties at enmity were united. <hi>I will give thee for a covenant of the people;</hi> that is, I make a gift of thee, to be to my people the ſummary and compend of all that bleſſed tranſaction and Covenant which I purpoſe with them. 2. It imports the commitment of the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs (which God purpoſed to do with his people in the
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:58137:232"/>way of a Covenant) unto Chriſt the Mediator, to be manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him: <hi>I will give thee for a covenant of the people,</hi> is a deſignation of Chriſts work, unto which he was called; and for the doing of which, promiſes of aſſiſtance are made to him in the words preceding theſe; as if it were ſaid, I ſet thee over the whole buſineſs of the Covenant between me and the people given to thee, that from beginning to end it may be managed by thee: Again, Chriſt is not only given <hi>for a Covenant,</hi> but for a <hi>Covenant of the people;</hi> that is, to be on the peoples ſide, and to deal for them: for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alone are not capable of confederation with God, but Chriſt ſtands jointly with them, and is gifted of God to the people, to be given back again to God for their part of the Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               <p>Hence let us conſider of theſe Propoſitions:</p>
               <p>Chriſt is all the Covenant: or all this Covenant is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in Chriſt: or God by giving Chriſt, doth give the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the people with him.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is the Covenant, 1. <hi>Originally and fundamentally:</hi> he is the original and root out of which the Covenant ſprang, and he is the foundation upon which it is grounded: the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace took its riſe and being from Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16, <hi>I Jeſus have ſent mine Angel to teſtifie unto you theſe things in the Churches: I am the root and the off-ſpring of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and the bright and morning-ſtar.</hi> Iſa. 28.16, <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſtone, a tryed ſtone, a precious corner-ſtone, a ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: he that believeth ſhall not make haſte.</hi> Judg. 14.14, <hi>And he ſaid unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the ſtrong came forth ſweetneſs.</hi> 1. He is the ancient foundation of that which was revealed of the Covenant from the beginning of the world: therefore God revealing this Covenant in Paradiſe, preſently after the fall, bottomed it upon Chriſt <hi>the ſeed of the woman,</hi> Gen. 3.15. And revealing it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he grounded it upon Chriſt <hi>Abrahams ſeed, in whom all the families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 12.3. and 17.1, 2. 2. Chriſt is the eternal foundation of this Covenant, upon whom it was bottomed in the eternal decrees of God: hence our vocation and ſalvation are ſaid to be promiſed and given to us in him before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:58137:232"/>
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2, <hi>And in hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promiſed befor the world began.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9, <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.</hi> Eph. 1.4, <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in love.</hi> 2. Chriſt is the Covenant <hi>primarily,</hi> and by <hi>propriety;</hi> as fire is hot for it ſelf, and all things hot for it, and by participtation: Becauſe with him was the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made as the chief party; which believers it was made in ſubordination to him: with him it was made at the firſt hand; with us at the ſecond hand: with him it was made for himſelf; with us it was only made for him: therefore 'tis his Covenant by propriety; and ours only by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and therefore all the promiſes are made firſt to him, and fulfilled firſt to him; and all the acts of Gods love ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate firſt upon him, and come at us only in the ſecond room, and at the ſecond hand, <hi>Iſa</hi> 59.21, <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord: My ſpirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, and for ever.</hi> Pſal. 89.3, 33, <hi>I have made a covenant with my choſen; I have ſworn unto David my ſervant.—Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, my loving-kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> Iſa. 53.3, <hi>And I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> Eph. 1.3, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt.</hi> 3. Chriſt is the Covenant <hi>eminently,</hi> becauſe he is the chief bleſſing of the Covenant; there being not ſuch another promiſe and gift in all the bundle of promiſes contained in the Covenant; therefore is he ſpoken of by way of eminence, as being that tranſcendent gift of God, matchleſs effect of Gods love, beſides which there is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the like, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10, <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith unto thee, give me to drink.</hi> Joh. 3.16, <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:58137:233"/>him, ſhould not periſh, but have overlaſting life.</hi> He is the moſt precious ſtone in all the Jewel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44, 45. All other things in the Covenant, Righteouſneſs, Life, Pardon, Peace, &amp;c. are but the garniſh of this Jewel, <hi>Song.</hi> 5.10, <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand.</hi> He is the moſt ſweet and ripeſt Berry in all the cluſter of Promiſes which grow together in the Covenant; nay, he is the cluſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er himſelf, <hi>Song.</hi> 1.14, <hi>My beloved is unto me as a cluſter of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.</hi> Rom. 8.32, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> He is the faireſt and moſt bright-ſhining ſtar in all that conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16, <hi>The bright and morning-ſtar.</hi> He is the faireſt ſtone in all the building, none like unto him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16, <hi>Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious corner-ſtone, a ſure foundation.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.4, <hi>To whom coming as unto a living ſtone, diſallowed indeed of men, hut choſen of God, and precious.</hi> Pſal. 118.22, <hi>The ſtone which the builders refuſed, is become the head-ſtone of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> He is the faireſt tree in all the garden of God, like the tree of Life in the midſt of <hi>Eden, Song.</hi> 2.3, <hi>As the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tree among the trees of the wood, ſo is my beloved among the ſons.</hi> Rev. 22.2, <hi>In the midſt of the ſtreets of it, and of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt is the Covenant <hi>virtually,</hi> or <hi>equivalently:</hi> he is the juſt value of all the bargain: he is of as much worth as all that is promiſed and contracted to believers in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace; ſo that if the value of it were asked, how much is it worth? it could not be anſwered otherwiſe, than ſo, 'Tis of as much value as Chriſt is: and when the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are fulfilled to the utmoſt, they amount not beyond the giving of Chriſt to believers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12, <hi>But as many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> Col. 1.27, <hi>Which is, Chriſt in you the hope of glory.</hi> Col. 3.11. Chriſt is all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt is the Covenant <hi>exemplarily,</hi> the very ſample and firſt pattern of the Covenant, and of the deſign of grace
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:58137:233"/>carried on by the Covenant, was in the union of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt the Mediators perſon: For conſider, I pray, the great deſign of favour carried on by the Covenant of grace, is an union of man with God, a reſtoring of man to the firſt ſtate of friendſhip with God, and in Chriſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; his perſon was the ſamplar and original pattern of all the buſineſs; to wit, 1. Of Gods infinite condeſcenſion and ſtooping ſo far towards a nearneſs, a union with man, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God: but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men.</hi> 2. Of the unſpeakable exaltation of our nature toward an union with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11, 16, <hi>For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham. For which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them brethren.</hi> 3. Of the union and conjunction of God and man, which is the reſult of Gods condeſcenſion, and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, and which is the ſummary of the ſecond Covenant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23, <hi>Immanuel, which being interpreted, is, God with us.</hi> Rev. 21.3, <hi>And God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God.</hi> So then, Chriſt is the Covenant in this reſpect alſo, the firſt ſamplar of the union and agreement of the parties covenanting, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14, <hi>For he is our peace, who hath made both one.</hi> Zech. 6.13, <hi>And the counſel of peace ſhall be between them both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt is the Covenant <hi>comprehenſively</hi> or <hi>ſummarily:</hi> he is the very compound or abridgment of the Covenant: in the Mediators perſon there is a little ſum of the whole Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: Conſider this, how the parties, articles, mutual ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, promiſes, properties and bleſſings of the Covenant, are all ſome way abridged in Chriſt, and ſummed up in his perſon. And, 1. Chriſt is all the parties of the Covenant of grace, or rather both the parties are comprehended in the Mediators perſon: he is both the parties in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; 1. Becauſe of the union of the two natures in his bleſſed perſon: he is <hi>God-man, God made manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. Who took not upon him our nature in its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive innocency and virgin integrity; <hi>But came in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3. He took upon him the nature of fallen man, but ſanctified for and by the union with the
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:58137:234"/>divine nature, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. And ſo he is both the parties, the Covenant being betwixt God and man, not innocent, but fallen man, yet believing and renewed man. 2. Becauſe the perſon who is Mediator, is upon both ſides of the Covenant: as being one with the Father and holy Ghoſt, he is on Gods ſide of the Covenant, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7, <hi>For there are three that bear record in heaven, the father, the word, and the holy Ghoſt: and theſe three are one.</hi> 2 Cor. 9.13, <hi>Whiles by the experiment of this miniſtration they glorifie God for your profeſſed ſubjection unto the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> And as he is one with us, he is on our ſide of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11, 13, <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are all of one: for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them brethren.—Behold I, and the children which God hath given me.</hi> 3. He is not only upon both ſides of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but he contracts for both the parties, carrying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a party, both upward to God, and downward to us: he treateth and covenanteth for God with us; and he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and covenanteth for us with God, which upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to carry, as having the repreſentation and ſum of both parties in his perſon, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, <hi>To wit, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf.</hi> Heb. 2.13, <hi>Behold I, and the children which God hath given me.</hi> And as it is ſaid of <hi>Jacobs</hi> repreſenting the people that came out of his Ioins, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4, <hi>He found him in Bethel, and there he ſpake with us:</hi> So it may be ſaid of Chriſts repreſenting his people, for God ſpoke with us in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſum of all the articles of the Covenant is in Chriſt: Conſider, I pray, what is the ſum of the Articles; even this, <hi>I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people:</hi> you find the articles of the Covenant frequently ſummed up in theſe two words, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. Now this is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, 1. In regard of the conjunction of relations in him; to wit, God owning the people, and the people owning him; he being the only perſon in heaven or earth, who doth bear or is capable to bear the relation of God towards the people; and again, of the people towards God; <hi>for he is God with us,</hi> Mat. 1.23. He is God and the people united and owning one another; and in ſome things he doth repreſent and carry forth God to us as ours, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. And in
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:58137:234"/>other things he doth repreſent and carry in the people of God, and preſent them before him as his own people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. and 2.13. Eph. 2.6. 2. In regard of cauſality: (for although Chriſt be not the cauſe of Gods love to the Elect, but the effect thereof, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16: yet he is the cauſe of the effects and acts whereby it runneth forth towards us) Chriſt is the bottom of the relation betwixt God and his people: for by his taking a new Covenant-right unto God as his God and Father by Covenant, he is lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods being our God by Covenant, and of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people of God by Covenant; which had never been, were it not for Chriſts new Covenant-right, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.26, <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my ſalvation.</hi> Gal. 4.6, <hi>And becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying; Abba, Father.</hi> Heb. 1.5, <hi>For unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? and again, I will be to him a father, and he ſhall be to me a ſon.</hi> 3. In regard of conveyance, or of the manner and way how we have acceſs to this priviledg and Covenant-ſtate, to have God to be our God: God is our God in Chriſt, and we are Gods people in and through Chriſt: and without an exiſtence in Chriſt, and union with him, God is not ours, neither are we his, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12, <hi>That at that time ye were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, being aliens from the commonwealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenant of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world.</hi> For Covenant-relations, as well as bleſſings, come to us through Chriſt: we come to God in Chriſt, and God cometh to us, and becometh ours in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, <hi>To wit, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf.</hi> Heb. 7.25, <hi>Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſum of the mutual ſtipulation is in Chriſt: there are ſome mutual conditions and ſtipulations in this as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenants. But Chriſt may be well called the whole ſtipulation: 1. Becauſe 'tis he who obtaineth the conſent of both parties, and receiveth in their Amen to that bleſſed tranſaction of friendſhip and union, the conſent of the one from everlaſting, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, 23, 30. with 2 Tim. 1.9. Tit.
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:58137:235"/>1.2: and of the other when we believe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17, 20. 2. Becauſe the Covenant was given to him, to be fulfilled on both ſides by him; it was fulfilled upon Gods ſide, for he is the perſon which was ſent to perform all that God had promiſed to his people, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.69, 70, 72, 73, 74, <hi>And hath raiſed up an horn to ſalvation for us, in the houſe of his ſervant David, as he ſpake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been ſince the world began: to perform the mercy promiſed to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant, the oath which he ſware to our father Abraham, that he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear.</hi> By him it was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon our part; for he is the perſon upon whom our help was laid, even to perform whatſoever is required of us by the Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.17, 19, <hi>For thou art the glory of their ſtrength.—Then thou ſpakeſt in viſion to thy holy one, and ſaidſt, I have laid help upon one that is mighty.</hi> 3. Becauſe upon the matter, Chriſt is the very thing which is mutually ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated upon both ſides: Conſider I pray, God ſtipulates to give us Chriſt, and that is the ſum of what he ſtipulates, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3, 4, <hi>Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your ſoul ſhall live: and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David. Behold, I have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him for a witneſs to the people, a leader and commander to the people.</hi> And again, we reſtipulate to give Chriſt to God for all that the Covenant requires of us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption.</hi> Phil. 3.9, <hi>And be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith.</hi> For this is the nature of the Goſpel-Covenant, it craveth conditions and duties from us, but filleth the hand with Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pay the maſters rent: and we do anſwer all that is craved with Chriſt, which maketh the craving gentle, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.17, <hi>I will alſo make thine officers peace, and thine exactors righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi>

<pb n="461" facs="tcp:58137:235"/>the firſt diſcovery of this Covenant, which had but one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in it, and that was the promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15, <hi>The ſeed of the woman.</hi> 2. This appears from Gods explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſum of the promiſes and Covenant, when it was more explicitely held forth to be Chriſt gifted to his people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3, <hi>And in thee ſhall all families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Iſa. 55.3, 4, <hi>And I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David. Behold, I have given him for a witneſs to the people.</hi> 3. This appears from the holy Ghoſts accounting Chriſts coming to be the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Covenant and promiſes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.69, 72, 73, <hi>And hath raiſed up an horn of ſalvation for us, in the houſe of his ſervant David: To perform the mercy promiſed to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant, the oath which he ſware to our father Abraham,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt is the ſum of all the properties of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, not only becauſe whatſoever theſe properties ſpeak forth of the nature of that tranſaction that is to be found in him; but alſo, and chiefly, becauſe Chriſt is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all theſe properties; as may appear by a ſhort recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of the particular properties thereof, which are all compriſed in Chriſt. And, 1. The <hi>freeneſs</hi> of the Covenant is compriſed in him. The Covenant of grace is <hi>free:</hi> and indeed Chriſt is <hi>a free Chriſt,</hi> or Chriſt freely given to his people is the ſum of the free Covenant, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life.</hi> Joh. 4.10, <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living-water.</hi> Iſa. 42.6, <hi>And give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.</hi> Rom. 8.32, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son: but delivered him up for us all: how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> Yea, 'tis in and for Chriſt that the Covenant is a free Covenant: for the ſame righteouſneſs, and life, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-bleſſings which are freely promiſed and offered to us, at the firſt hand were purchaſed by Chriſt, and a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given to the juſtice of God for them; and becauſe he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a price for them, therefore they are free gifts to us: he
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:58137:236"/>made all Covenant-mercies free to us by Covenant, becauſe they were bought by him, in the Covenant that was made between God and Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12, <hi>Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him: he hath put him to grief: when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied: by his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many: for he ſhall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong: becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death; and he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors, and he bare the ſin of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Joh. 17.4, 5, <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do. And now, O father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi> I do not ſay that Chriſt was the cauſe of Gods eternal tranſaction which he purpoſed in himſelf; but that he is the cauſe of theſe effects of Covenant-graces, which come freely to us for his ſake, who bought them with a great price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20, 21, <hi>But with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a lamb without blemiſh, without ſpot. Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times for you who by him do believe in God that raiſed him up from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.</hi>

It is in and for him, that it is ſatisfying: if Chriſt were not in the Covenant, the ſoul of a Saint could nevery ſay of it, <hi>This is all my deſire;</hi> but becauſe he is in it, therefore the ſpirits of men by imbracing it, find a ſatisfaction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2, 5, 6, <hi>O my ſoul, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my Lord: the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou maintaineſt my lot.

For diſcovery how far we fall ſhort in practical giving to Chriſt his own place in the Covenant: There be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few, even of thoſe who dare not knowingly ſlight Chriſt, who yet do give him his own room in the Covenant. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it but a little: 1. He is the root and original of the Covenant: have you acknowledged and imployed him as ſuch? have your ſoul-tranſactions with God, been grounded upon
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:58137:239"/>Chriſts tranſactions with him? or have you not in point of Soul-covenanting with God, dealt as if the Covenant had its firſt riſe then, when it firſt entered in thy heart? Conſider, I pray, where you have pitched the original riſe and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that bleſſed tranſaction. 2. He is the principal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with whom the Covenant was made at the firſt hand: do you always give that place to Chriſt? do you put him fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt? or do you not rather drudg him after you? I fear, nay I doubt not, we deal in many things with God as if we were the principal party covenanting: in matter of Goſpel-promiſes, as if we were the principal Creditor, to whom a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of theſe things were due: and in matter of Goſpel-commands, as if we were the principal Debtors from whom a performance of Duty could be expected. 3. Chriſt is the chief bleſſing of the covenant: have you ſought him as ſuch? or hath any other bleſſing of the Covenant had his room in thy heart? have you ſought life and ſalvation in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as the chief bleſſing contained in them? or have you ſeen ſomething in the promiſes better and more deſirable than theſe, even Chriſt, who is in every promiſe, and is the beſt thing in the promiſe? 4. He is valuable above all things elſe contained in the Covenant: he is the full price of the whole bargain; have you put this value upon him? have you made him your all, your treaſure for which you treated in this bargain, and bought the field? 5. He is the ſamplar and firſt copy of the Covenant: did you ever conſider how the peace and union was firſt made in his perſon? have you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that bleſſed copy, to have this your Covenant with God, the Divine Nature coming down to you, and you brought up to meet with God in Chriſt, and with him, and in him to have myſtical union? 6.

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:58137:243"/>and weakneſſes, and all the miſeries of your preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Chriſt is given for a Covenant of the people: and though you be fooliſh, he is wiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom.</hi> Though you be weak, he is ſtrong, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19, <hi>I have laid help up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one that is mighty.</hi> Mat. 12.29, <hi>Or elſe how can one enter into a ſtrong mans houſe, and ſpoil his goods, except he firſt bind the ſtrong man, and then he will ſpoil his houſe?</hi> Though you be faithleſs, he is faithful, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13, <hi>If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Though you be nothing, <hi>Chriſt is all,</hi> Col. 3.11. Whatſoever is wanting in you, is abounding in him; and if you abuſe not the grace of Chriſt by turning it into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, it is all one if it be betwixt you: its as good and much better it be in him than in you: for if he be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to you, all comes with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Believers in Chriſt, you who have received him who was given for a Covenant of the people, take courage and boldneſs to God-ward in all that you have to do with him: For, 1. Having received Chriſt for a Covenant of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you may pray and deal confidently with God, as though Chriſt did beſeech God by you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the holy one of Iſrael, and his maker, Ask me of things to come, concerning my Sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.</hi> 2. You have gotten Chriſt, and therefore nothing ſhall be denied you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all: how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> 3. You have received more than you know of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.4, 5, 20, <hi>And whither I go ye know, and the way you know. Thomas ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Lord, we know not whither thou goeſt: and how can we know the way?—at that day ye ſhall know that I am in my father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi> You have all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, if you have him. 4. You have received more than you want, a greater thing than ever you ſhall be capable to need or want hereafter; for how great ſoever your wants be, you cannot conceive them to be ſo great as Chriſt, who
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:58137:244"/>is given to you, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19, <hi>But my God ſhall ſupply all your need, according to his riches in glory by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> 2 Cor. 9.8, <hi>And God is able to make all grace abound towards you, that ye always having all ſufficiency in all things, may abound to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good work.</hi>
